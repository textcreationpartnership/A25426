            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT was the Opinion of the Great <hi>Lord Verulam,</hi> That <hi>Books</hi> (ſuch as in earneſt deſerve <hi>that Title</hi>) need no other <hi>Patrons</hi> than <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Let the <hi>Abortives</hi> of the <hi>Preſs</hi> Court your favour; This <hi>Treatiſe</hi> ſecurely Appeals to your <hi>ſevereſt</hi> (provided it be but unprejudiced) Judgment.</p>
            <p>It was Compoſed divers years ago, by the Dictates of a <hi>NOBLE PERSON,</hi> of <hi>whom,</hi> when I have ſaid, That he was an Eminent <hi>Miniſter of State,</hi> a known <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and one of the moſt Studious Gentlemen of our Age, equally diligent and happy in Reading both <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> I ſhall have expreſs'd but part of His Character: The reſt of which, when you have peruſed this <hi>Elaborate Diſcourſe,</hi> you will better be enabled to ſupply by thoſe Idaea's of <hi>Veneration,</hi> which it cannot but raiſe in minds that have any reſpect to <hi>Truth, Piety,</hi> or <hi>Learning.</hi>

            <p>All that I can pretend to, is the Honour of being a little Inſtrumental to hand <hi>That</hi> forth to publick Light, which I thought was too <hi>valuable</hi> to be doom'd to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of a <hi>private Cloſet;</hi> as being unwilling the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>The Meaning of the Title.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. TO explain the meaning of the Title of this Work:

Jus proprietatis. Cook</hi> on <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton,</hi> f. 345.</note> It may be inquired firſt, what is meant by the word <hi>Right?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Civilians</hi> ſay that Right is the ſame with Juſt; that which is conſtituted by right Law, and by juſt and lawful means, that is Right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtinian</hi> called the Law <hi>Right, Rectum;</hi> ſo the <hi>French</hi> ſay <hi>Droict.</hi> That which the Civil Lawyers term, what is according to the <hi>Praeſcripts and Rules of the Civil Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame ſignification it bears in our Law, and our antient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors call it <hi>Jus,</hi> as <hi>Right of Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Right of Property.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if a Tenant in Fee make a Leaſe for Years, and afterwards releaſe all his <hi>Right,</hi> his whole Eſtate is thereby paſt away, and what he had by <hi>Law,</hi> he hath given away by this Releaſe of his <hi>Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which we call a Man's Right, is that which is <hi>due,</hi> which by Law and Juſtice he ought to have.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62687:6"/>
               <p n="2">2. Next, We may conſider the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Right,</hi> which is, what the Law and Juſtice gives to the King, that which is due to him.</p>
               <p>The Right of the King of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>no new upſtart Right,</hi> but of great <hi>Antiquity,</hi> injoyed by his Predeceſſors from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Government amongſt us. It is no Uſurped Right, but deſcended to him from his Royal Anceſtors, by <hi>Succeſſion</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is <hi>no diſputable Right,</hi> but certain and clear, defined by the known Laws of this Kingdom, and general Conſent of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have ſubmitted thereunto.</p>
               <p>It is no <hi>Subordinate Right,</hi> our King acknowledgeth no Superior, his Empire is Independant, under God, and as Soveraign by Law, as any Prince's in Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Grant,</hi> may be our next Argument, wherein I intend not to argue the ſeveral ſorts of the King's Grants under the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> the <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> or his <hi>Sign Manuel,</hi> and the force of ſuch Grants.</p>
               <p>This is not our preſent buſineſs, but the meaning of the King's Grant, as we intend it, is, where he gives or beſtows his Favour and Indulgence to any of his Subjects, by ſuch ways and legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance or Grant thereof, as is Valid and Effectual, to thoſe to whom it is made, be it under the Great Seal or otherwiſe; this is meant by the King's Grant.</p>
               <p>And it is the Honourable Intention of the King, that all his Grants ſhould be <hi>effectual</hi> and <hi>valid,</hi> as the Grants of <hi>a King</hi> ought to be, elſe his Officers do not their duty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may now inquire the meaning of <hi>Indulgence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word <hi>Indulgentia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spieg. <hi>Is cui alimenta re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licta fuerant in metallis, damnatus. Dd. in exped. ard. de Por. c. ult. l.</hi> 6. Spieg. <hi>Lib. in quaſd.</hi> 13. <hi>ſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>cap. de Sen. paſſ. &amp; reſtit.</hi> 9. <hi>in Extra. de Paen. &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſ. L.</hi> 2.3.11. <hi>c. de ſent. paſ. Briſ.</hi>
                  </note> was properly uſed for the leaving of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals for one, who is condemned to the Mines.</p>
               <p>It comprehends generally a <hi>Permiſſion,</hi> a <hi>Condeſcention,</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Lenity</hi> or <hi>mildneſs;</hi> So it uſed in the Civil Laws, and the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists</hi> take it for <hi>a Pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It comprehends a <hi>Recovery</hi> or Reſtitution of Dignity, Lands, and of all things loſt.</p>
               <p>Moſt pertinent to our purpoſe is the Senſe, wherein the <hi>Gloſs</hi> takes it, that it means <hi>a relaxation of Puniſhment,</hi> which one is to undergo for his Offences, a grant of the Prince's Clemency, by which a Subject is <hi>freed from Puniſhment,</hi> and in this ſenſe doth the Law of <hi>England</hi> alſo mean <hi>an Indulgence,</hi> and is the ſame with <hi>a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> an Exemption, a Pardon, or a Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We may likewiſe inquire the meaning of <hi>Spiritual Matters;</hi> by them are meant, ſuch matters as concern the <hi>Soul</hi> or Spirit,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62687:6"/>ſuch as concern the Worſhip of God, in Doctrine and Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>It is no looſe Conſideration,
<note place="margin">Seneca <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 27.</note> by what Care and Coſt Kingdoms and States ſhould be preſerved, being they derive and uphold all happineſs to Men. The only infallible ground of their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is <hi>true Religion,</hi> the worſhip of God in Spirit and in Truth.</p>
               <p>And though <hi>ill manners</hi> are by accident, the cauſe,
<note place="margin">Ex malis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus bonae le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> or rather oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of <hi>good Laws,</hi> which are better in <hi>execution</hi> and beſt in <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> yet <hi>good manners</hi> cauſe obedience, and Religion begets <hi>good manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Spiritual matters are matters of Religion, but Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt without <hi>Publick Exerciſe</hi> and action, and the requiſits thereof.</p>
               <p>If the Expreſſion <hi>Spiritual,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. Nye <hi>of the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</hi>
                  </note> be interpreted by the contradiſtinct member <hi>Temporal,</hi> it ſeems to direct us to underſtand ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as concern Eternity, for that is the true oppoſite to what is <hi>Temporal. The things that are ſeen are Temporal;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.18.</note> 
                  <hi>and the things that are not ſeen, are Eternal.</hi> This we mean by <hi>Matters Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But it may be now not improper to expreſs in the <hi>negative,</hi> what I do not mean by this Indulgence, and then what I do mean by it.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Indulgence</hi> I do not mean that a toleration ſhould be granted by the King of any known Blaſphemy or Sin. Neither do I mean ſuch Indulgences whereof <hi>Luther</hi> complains, that for Money In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence was granted for Sin, and redemption out of Purgatory; ſurely none can pardon Sin but God alone, and Money got by ſuch means periſheth with the getter.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But in the affirmative, by Indulgence in Spiritual matters, is meant a permiſſion of <hi>Liberty of mens Conſciences, in matters not ſinful of themſelves, and whereby there is no diſturbance of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That where Men out of tenderneſs of Conſcience cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſome particulars injoyned by Authority, in matters touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Worſhip, fearing or doubting, leaſt if they ſhould do it, they ſhould offend God, and hazard the ſalvation of their precious Souls; and upon theſe grounds do not conform, yet live peaceably.</p>
               <p>For an Indulgence and Permiſſion to theſe Perſons to ſerve God as they think moſt for the good of their own Souls, eſpecially when they agree in Fundamentals with the reſt of their Brethren. That theſe may not be puniſhed in their <hi>Eſtates</hi> or <hi>Liberties,</hi> much leſs in their <hi>Lives,</hi> for Nonconformity. This is that Indulgence which is meant in matters Spiritual.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>That from Grounds of Policy, Indulgence in Spiritual Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is fit to be granted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IT will be needleſs to diſcourſe of the King's Right to grant Indulgence in Spiritual matters, unleſs it be fit and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that ſuch Indulgence be granted.</p>
               <p>If it be not fit to be granted, the King will not grant it, his wiſdom and affection to his People, will diſſwade him from it; therefore before we proceed any further in this Argument, it will not be impertinent to enquire, whether ſuch Indulgence be fit to be granted or not.</p>
               <p>And it ſeems to me <hi>very clear,</hi> that <hi>it is fit to be granted;</hi> and that firſt from grounds of <hi>Polity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief grounds of Polity is the preſervation of the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> to which nothing more conduceth, than the granting ſuch Indulgence. Other grounds of Polity therein, are the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Trade,</hi> the increaſe of <hi>People,</hi> their <hi>dependance upon the Prince,</hi> and the <hi>quieting of mens troubled minds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon all which grounds is inferrd, and that in Polity, the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch Indulgence; and we ſhall take the liberty to treat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of them in order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſeems fit, for the better preſervation of the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> that ſuch Indulgence be granted. <hi>Tacitus</hi> notes, <hi>That it is ſafer to let paſs things grown up and ſtrong in diſcrepancy, than to provoke them to future diſcords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When things are old and rooted, they labour in vain, who would remove them by <hi>violence,</hi> the ſhaking of them makes them but the <hi>firmer.</hi> To unite Men in Religion by force, is to cauſe <hi>the Sword</hi> to be drawn,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>French Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> H. 4.</note> which is not ſo eaſily ſheathed again.</p>
               <p>Princes well adviſed, have never put ſome of their Subjects to death, to make others believe, that they have not waſted their Provinces by War, but to inſtruct the Conſciences of their Subjects by the Sword; knowing that Religion is an act of Union, Concord, and Inſtruction; War nothing elſe but Miſery and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And they who have moved <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> that is, have made uſe of every Engine to force the Conſciences of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, into the <hi>ſame Religion,</hi> have been conſtrained at laſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, rejecting the Counſels of bad Phyſicians, who have nothing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62687:7"/>but <hi>Stibium</hi> and <hi>letting of blood,</hi> for all ſorts of Diſeaſes. Where <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> cannot be enjoyed, the Canker of <hi>Civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> frets and eats till it can break forth into <hi>open Sedition.</hi> But by granting an Indulgence, both their Minds and Perſons become <hi>peaceable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That this is ſo, appears from the Examples of ſome of our Neighbours, who had many troubles and much diſturbances of their Peace, before Indulgence was granted to <hi>Diſſenters</hi> among them, and much Peace and Security after it.</p>
               <p>This was the caſe of the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> whom their Governours could not retain in Peaceful Obedience, till they had granted this Indulgence, which with them is very large, yet is eſteemed a chief cauſe of their Peace and Civil Unity; nor do any flouriſh more in Trade and all Security.</p>
               <p>That wiſe and gallant Prince, <hi>H.</hi> IV. of <hi>France,</hi> ſaw ſo great Miſchiefs in his State, and ſuch a floud of Civil Diſſention, for want of this Indulgence, that he thought fit to grant it, and told his Parliament, That Neceſſity and Utility moved him to do it by the Advice of all his Council, who found it good and neceſſary for the State of his Affairs, and the good of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to confirm the Indulgence, and to diſſipate thoſe unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that Diſcord had produced, and it would be found equally prudent, peaceful and happy, for every Prince to follow this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That by ſuch <hi>Indulgence</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> will be the better preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, appears further by Examples of elder times, Chriſtians have been ſo ſtrangely hated and perſecuted in the Birth of the Church, that ſome gave them no other Names but of <hi>Impoſtors;</hi> others ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed them of the injury of the <hi>Air,</hi> of the ſterility of the <hi>Seaſons,</hi> of the overflowing of <hi>Rivers,</hi> and of <hi>Earth-quakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> would not that they ſhould be curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſearched into, as to the matter of Religion; and <hi>Antoninus</hi> his Succeſſor, commanded that he that accuſed them ſhould be <hi>burnt alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the whole Empire had found the publique Proſecutions of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximinius</hi> to be vain and fruitleſs, and that for one Chriſtian they cauſed to be Burnt, an <hi>hundred</hi> ſprang up out of their Aſhes; their Succeſſors found it true,

                  </note> That Kings have not the ſame command <hi>over Hearts as over Bodies.</hi> That Religion could not <hi>be forced,</hi> that Truth could not be joyned with Violence, nor Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice with Cruelty; and that there is nothing ſo free as Religion, nothing ſo voluntary; that the Permiſſion and Indulgence of that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62687:8"/>freedom tends moſt to the preſervation of <hi>Publique Peace,</hi> a main ground of all Polity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pagan</hi> Princes have found it ſo,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pagans</hi> have Indulged <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </note> by Indulging the Chriſtians. And it was Objected againſt <hi>Decius,</hi> that his want of Moderation towards the Chriſtians, robbed him of the Title of a Great and Righteous Prince.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian Princes alſo have Indulged <hi>Pagans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>The Emperours <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> though burning with the Zeal of advancing their Religion, yet would not that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens ſhould <hi>be forced</hi> to be Chriſtians; and required of all Judges and Preſidents of Provinces, not to trouble them, ſo long as they did live without Diſturbance or Sedition. It were hard for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to deny the like favour and Indulgence to one another.</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and other Countries, and whereſoever they were driven out of any Kingdom, it was not for <hi>their Religion,</hi> but for their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuries</hi> and great <hi>Cruelties;</hi> and it would be hard to ſee theſe in quiet who <hi>deny Chriſt,</hi> and Proteſtants hurried to Priſon for diſliking Surplices or ſome little things.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, A violent way of <hi>force</hi> will never be found a way to preſerve <hi>Peace,</hi> where a mild way of Indulgence is open, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been taken, it appears by Examples both of <hi>elder</hi> and <hi>latter</hi> times, that it hath been found by Princes, the beſt way to preſerve their Tranquility.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Upon the grounds of Polity, from the conſideration of the the preſent ſtate of our Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> it ſeems ſit that this Indulgence be granted, and that thereby our Peace will the better be preſerved.</p>
               <p>The Baltique and other deep Seas being once moved by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, do ſwell and rowl high for many hours after, and a ſmall new Storm raiſes them yet much higher.</p>
               <p>After hideous Storms of Civil Diſcord in <hi>England,</hi> the Affairs thereof through the miraculous goodneſs of God in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Reſtoration, are come into a calm ſtate, yet the more apt to <hi>rage,</hi> becauſe ſo <hi>lately moved,</hi> and therefore ſurely all Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62687:8"/>courſes are to be avoided, and Provocations laid aſide.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>three</hi> ways of ſtopping Commotion from raging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by <hi>Force,</hi> by <hi>Extirpation,</hi> or by <hi>Indulgence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Force be uſed to keep <hi>Diſſenters</hi> quiet, and to compel Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, this Force cannot be maintained without a vaſt <hi>Charge;</hi> this Charge will increaſe <hi>Diſcontent</hi> in them and others; that muſt cauſe <hi>increaſe of Force;</hi> that again, <hi>increaſe of Charge;</hi> and that, of <hi>Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;</hi> and ſo it will run round in a courſe of unhappineſs and unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſs.</p>
               <p>It were Impiety in a Prince to be angry with his <hi>own</hi> Countrey, he ought rather to imitate good Phyſitians, who having uſed <hi>ſharp</hi> Remedies without profit, do apply <hi>ſweet</hi> ones.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are for an Extirpation of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> would un-people their Native Countrey, diſarm their Prince of <hi>ſo may thouſands</hi> of Strong and Valiant Subjects, abate their own Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and the publique Wealth and Trade, to enrich Foreign Countries. Some mercileſs Fancies would force a Conformity on <hi>Pain of Death,</hi> a ſure way of Extirpation.</p>
               <p>Such Tyrannous men are like their Predeceſſor, infamous in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, who would have all conform to his <hi>Stature;</hi> thoſe who were not ſo <hi>tall</hi> as he, to be racked out to his <hi>length;</hi> thoſe who were <hi>taller</hi> then he, to be <hi>cut ſtort</hi> to the length of his Bed.</p>
               <p>Certainly there is as much difference in <hi>Judgments</hi> as in <hi>Statures,</hi> and as little reaſon to except againſt the one as the other, or to impoſe Conformity in <hi>Opinion,</hi> as in <hi>Complexion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe (who are no kin to <hi>Moſes</hi>) fancy Impoſſibilities when they fancy an Extirpation; by theſe means did the Maſſacre in <hi>France</hi> Extirpate thoſe of <hi>the Religion?</hi> It did indeed thoſe who were Murthered, but it made the <hi>Diſſent</hi> to grow.</p>
               <p>They are like <hi>Camomile,</hi> the more they are bruiſed and trod upon, the more they <hi>flouriſh,</hi> as the ſtories of the Church do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
               <p>In the laſt and beſt place it will be found that the granting of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence is the ſureſt and moſt probable way of preſerving the Publique Peace.</p>
               <p>But hereof there will be occaſion to Treat more at large in a following Section.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another ground of Polity for the allowing of this Indulgence, is for the Advancement of the TRADE of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are generally <hi>Sober Induſtrious Trading men,</hi> not Debauched <hi>Drones,</hi> Born only to conſume <hi>Corn and Wine;</hi> but ſuch as can do more Service for their Prince than meerly to <hi>Drink his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62687:9"/>Health.</hi> Every Trader, Merchant, or Artificer, bringeth <hi>Wealth</hi> to the Publique, and adds to the Kings <hi>Revenue;</hi> they are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Members of a <hi>State,</hi> and add much to common <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Safety.</hi> Merchants are <hi>honourable,</hi> and Artificers had the title of <hi>Fathers,</hi> and both deſerve encouragement.</p>
               <p>But without <hi>this Indulgence,</hi> there will need <hi>no Law</hi> to baniſh multitudes of theſe men, they will <hi>baniſh themſelves,</hi> if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy their deareſt intereſt, <hi>the Liberty of their Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be denyed them in their native Country, they will ſeek it in the <hi>remoteſt Regions,</hi> rather than not enjoy it. And they will be <hi>welcome</hi> whereſoever they go. Even <hi>Pagans</hi> will allow them <hi>this liberty,</hi> if their fellow Proteſtants will not.</p>
               <p>But I ſuppoſe and hope that no ſober <hi>Engliſh man</hi> will think of any ſuch way as <hi>extirpation,</hi> by baniſhment or death of thoſe who differ in Opinion from them. If theſe Diſſenters be encouraged by Indulgence, it will highly tend to the advancement of the <hi>Trade</hi> of the Kingdom. If they be forced out of it, the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> will find it in the decay of their <hi>Rents;</hi> the King will find it in the emptineſs of his <hi>Coffers;</hi> and the People, as well as their Prince, will be ſenſible of the miſchief upon any conteſt with <hi>Forreigners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Another ground of Polity for the granting of this Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is, That thereby <hi>the People of the Kingdom will be increaſed,</hi> they will be kept from going out of it, and live comfortably, and increaſe within it. But by denyal of this Indulgence, the great numbers of People and their Children, and Childrens Children, which will leave the Kingdom, and be born, and inhabit <hi>other</hi> Countries, will diſpeople and weaken <hi>England.</hi> The ſtrength and wealth of a Prince and People conſiſts in <hi>their multitude;</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that Prince who hath <hi>his Quiver full of People. He ſhall not be aſhamed when he ſpeaks with his Enemy;</hi> but the loſs of every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Induſtrious Man, is a loſs both to King and Kingdom. It was the bleſſing to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 17.5.</note> that his Seed ſhould be as the <hi>Stars of Heaven</hi> for multitude, and therefore God would have his Name called <hi>Abraham,</hi> for a <hi>Father of many Nations have I made thee.</hi> And the Word <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>high Father of a multitude.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Prince is <hi>a Father of</hi> his Country,
<note place="margin">Pater exce'ſus multitudinis.</note> and the more Subjects he hath, the more <hi>Children</hi> he hath, and the more happy and <hi>ſtrong</hi> he is, and the loſs of any one, is the loſs of <hi>a Child</hi> to him. It was the anſwer of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to her Parliaments advice for her <hi>to marry,</hi> that ſhe might have <hi>Children</hi> to ſucceed her, That <hi>every Engliſh man was her Child.</hi> Now the granting of this Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62687:9"/>will keep the <hi>Children</hi> at home with their <hi>politique Father,</hi> whoſe Riches, and Honour, and Strength, will be increaſed by their increaſe. But by driving them away, the Prince will loſe <hi>his Children,</hi> impare his Revenue, and weaken his Kingdom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a Forreign Invaſion, and Domeſtick troubles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another ground of Polity for this Indulgence, is becauſe thereby the Perſons to whom it is granted, will be brought to an <hi>intire dependence</hi> on their Prince who grants it. No intereſt in the world is ſo dear to theſe <hi>Diſſenters</hi> as the liberty of their <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> and where they have <hi>this,</hi> the intereſt of it obligeth them to <hi>be faithful</hi> to that Power which gives it, elſe they are not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their own intereſt. Nothing binds more firmly than <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> and no intereſt is more ſtrong to bind, more beloved, or more deſired than this Freedom, and therefore bindeth thoſe to faithfulneſs where they have it. Subjection is due in regard of <hi>Protection,</hi> and where theſe Men have the liberty of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from a Prince, the intereſt of preſerving that Liberty oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to be faithful to, and to preſerve <hi>his Power,</hi> by which this <hi>great intereſt</hi> of theirs is preſerved. If the Prince fall who grants this Liberty, the Liberty falls <hi>with him,</hi> they that will maintain the <hi>Gift,</hi> know that they muſt ſupport the Giver alſo. It is <hi>ſafe</hi> for a Prince by ſuch ways, to oblige his Subjects, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as <hi>theſe,</hi> who are for the moſt part of <hi>conſtant, ſtout,</hi> and <hi>induſtrious Spirits,</hi> to a dependance on him, whoſe ſervice will be the more available to him. And it is their <hi>Tenet</hi> that this Indulgence cannot be enjoyed with ſo much certainty and ſtability under any other, as under their <hi>native Legal Government.</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath its name from <hi>binding,</hi> and there can be no firmer bond of Subjects to their Soveraign, than when they enjoy the freedom of their <hi>Religion</hi> from their Princes favour; and the continuance of this higheſt comfort and intereſt, depends upon the ſafety and good of him that grants it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The laſt ground of Polity which I ſhall now mention for the granting of this Indulgence, is, becauſe thereby <hi>Mens minds will be ſatisfied.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are in doubts and fears leaſt they <hi>may be puniſhed</hi> and perſecuted for their Diſſent, whilſt they ſee and feel <hi>Laws</hi> rigorouſly executed upon them, or others in the ſame condition, this perplexeth their thoughts, diſturbs them in their buſineſs, cauſeth them to tranſport their Stocks or part of them into other Countries, and ſometimes their <hi>Perſons</hi> and Trades with them, which hath been no ſmall detriment to <hi>England</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and may it be ſo no more. But by ſuch <hi>Indulgence</hi> Mens
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62687:10"/>minds will be quieted, they will chearfully and undiſturbed follow their Vocations, whereby Trade will be promoted, and the Wealth, Strength, and Peace of the <hi>King</hi> and his Kingdom will be advanced.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another ground of <hi>Piety,</hi> for this Indulgence, is from that Rule of the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.32.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye kind one to another, tender hearted.</hi> And ſurely theſe are too far from it, who have no kindneſs or regard to tender Conſciences. The ſame Apoſtle demandeth, <hi>Why is my liberty judged of anothers Conſcience?</hi> implying, that it ought not to be ſo, none can judge of anothers Conſcience but God. To be <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted</hi> to a Brother, is the way to gain <hi>tender mercies</hi> from our Heavenly Father; and to be kind to others, will gain kindneſs to our ſelves in the concluſion. But for anothers Conſcience to judge of my <hi>Liberty;</hi> to impoſe upon others Conſciences who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from us, and vigorouſly to require them to obey <hi>Man</hi> rather than <hi>God,</hi> (as they eſteem it) To order their Conformity to ſuch

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, Liberties, and Lives too, if they do not Conform; this will hardly be judged at the Great Day, to have been <hi>kind to one another,</hi> or to have been <hi>tender-hearted.</hi> But to bear with the Infirmities of others, to indulge them in ſuch things as are not ſinful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not to force their Conſciences; this is agreeable to the Rules of Chriſtianity, and is a ground of Piety for granting this Indulgence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another ground of Piety for the ſame, is, That we are to <hi>leave it to God</hi> to perform his own Works. We ought to leave the triumph and conqueſt of <hi>Souls</hi> to the eternal Wiſdom, who re-makes and faſhions <hi>Hearts</hi> as he pleaſeth,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>History of</hi> France, H. 4.</note> and gives the Signal to ſo many ſtraying Souls to cauſe them to enter into Salvation, it being impoſſible for <hi>Men</hi> to impoſe any neceſſity upon things which God hath left <hi>free,</hi> as mens <hi>Conſciences</hi> are, which ought to be <hi>as free</hi> in a State as their <hi>Thoughts.</hi> And thoſe who impoſe upon them, and would <hi>help God</hi> by that way to ſave Souls, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume too much upon their own judgments, and have too little ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of God's omnipotence. What he hath commanded, his <hi>Vicegerents</hi> are to ſee done, but no command of ſuch <hi>impoſing</hi> is to be found; rather to be believed that God hath <hi>reſerved</hi> the direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe things to himſelf as his own Work. It was wiſe Counſel of the Doctor of the Law, <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> to the Publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, <hi>Refrain from theſe men, and let them alone;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 5.35, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>for if this Counſel, or this Work be of Men, it will come to naught; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, leſt happily ye be found even to fight againſt God.</hi> It were well if ſome in our Age had taken this Counſel, and left the Works of God to be done by God, who is more wiſe and able to perform them, than his poor, ſinful, weak Creatures are. If that which is called by ſome a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a State, or that which others call <hi>Evil,</hi> be grown old, it will be difficult to ſhake that which is deeply rooted, eſpecially by the weak hand of feeble <hi>Men,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> will ſurely root it up, if it be <hi>Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4: Another ground of <hi>Piety</hi> for this Indulgence is, becauſe the ſubject matter is altogether <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Biſhop</hi> Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor's <hi>Liberty of Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
                  </note> It is excellently ſaid by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> on this ſubject: That to believe ſo, or not ſo, when there is no more but <hi>meer believing,</hi> is not in the Magiſtrates power to <hi>enjoyn,</hi> therefore not to <hi>puniſh.</hi> And it is not only lawful to Tollerate diſagreeing Perſwaſions, but the authority of God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62687:11"/>is competent to take notice of it, and fit to judge, becauſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible to determine it. And therefore (ſaith the Biſhop) <hi>No Humane Authority is ſufficient to do thoſe things which can justify the inflicting Temporal Puniſhments upon ſuch as do not conform in their Perſwaſions,</hi> to a Rule or Authority which is not only <hi>fallible,</hi> but ſuppoſed by the diſagreeing Perſons to be actually <hi>deceived.</hi> And none can judge between them in this Spiritual matter, but God alone. If men ſhall do deſpite to the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> God will Puniſh them with much more Severity than this World can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.30.31.</note> as the Apoſtle Notes, <hi>For we know him that hath ſaid, Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance belongeth unto me, I will Recompence, ſaith the Lord: And again, The Lord ſhall judge his People. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> By this and ſundry other Texts, it ſeems to me not obſcure, that God reſerves to himſelf the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of matters meerly <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and which are not <hi>Sin</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or but doubtful; in thoſe caſes he would not have the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> to determine and puniſh. But if he do impoſe upon Gods Servants, and Perſecute them as <hi>Evil doers,</hi> when perhaps they are <hi>not ſo</hi> (which in theſe Spiritual matters no man can judge) This will be to tread under foot the Son of God; and if the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts</hi> ſhall do ſo, or the <hi>Impoſers</hi> ſhall do ſo, <hi>Vengeance is Gods;</hi> a temporal Magiſtrate cannot inflict a Puniſhment accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the demerit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth ground of <hi>Piety</hi> for this Indulgence is from the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church</hi> in the beſt times. The Church hath always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted Hereſies, and yet the Puniſhments which ſhe hath uſed, have been more <hi>Shameful</hi> then <hi>Cruel,</hi> more <hi>Medicinal</hi> than <hi>Mortal,</hi> lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather to ſee their Faces <hi>Bluſh</hi> with <hi>Shame,</hi>

               <p n="8">8.

               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The laſt ground of <hi>Piety</hi> for this Indulgence, which I ſhall now mention, is from the conſideration of the <hi>Introduction of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> It is (ſaith Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi>) one of the Glories of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, that it was ſo Pious, Excellent, Miraculous, and Perſwaſive, that it <hi>came in upon its own Piety and Wiſdom,</hi> with no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62687:13"/>other <hi>force</hi> but a terrent of Arguments and <hi>demonſtration of the Spirit,</hi> a mighty ruſhing Wind to break down all ſtrong Holds, and every <hi>high Thought</hi> and <hi>Imagination.</hi> But towards the <hi>Perſons of Men</hi> it was always full of <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> Compliance and Toleration, Condeſcention, and bearing with one another, reſtoring Perſons overtaken with an Error in the <hi>Spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> conſidering leaſt we <hi>alſo be tempted.</hi> The conſideration is as prudent, and the <hi>Proportion</hi> as juſt, as the <hi>Precept</hi> is charitable, and the <hi>Preſident</hi> was pious and holy. Now every thing is beſt conſerved with that which gave it the firſt Being, and is agreeable to its temper and conſtitution. The Precept which the Chriſtian Religion chiefly preaches, in order to all the Bleſſedneſs in this and the other World, is <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> Mercy, and Charity: And this ſhould alſo help and preſerve it ſelf, and promote its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; for indeed nothing will do it ſo well, nothing doth ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently inſinuate it ſelf into the underſtandings and affections of Men, as when the actngs and perſwaſions of a Sect, and every part and principle are tending to a univerſal Good. And it would be a mighty diſparagement to ſo glorious an Inſtitution, That in its <hi>Principles</hi> it ſhould be merciful and humane, and yet in the <hi>promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>propagation</hi> of it, ſo inhumane. And it would be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and unreaſonable, that the Sword ſhould be uſed in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>one Propoſition,</hi> and yet in the perſwaſion of the <hi>whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> nothing like it. To do ſo, may ſometimes ſeem, and but ſeem to ſerve the Intereſts of a Temporal Prince, but never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the honour of <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom;</hi> it may ſecure a Deſign of <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> but it will much diſſerve <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to offer to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it by that which good Men believe to be a diſtinctive Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, from the Excellency and Piety of Chriſtianity, whoſe Eſſence and Spirit is deſcribed in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent words of St.

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62687:13"/>or a verification of the Propoſition, therefore the Underſtanding is not ſubject to Humane Authority. We ſee that the greateſt <hi>Perſecutions</hi> that ever have been, were againſt <hi>Truth,</hi> even againſt Chriſtianity it ſelf; and it was a Prediction of our Bleſſed <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> That Perſecution ſhould be the Lot of <hi>true Believers.</hi> And if we compute the experience of Suffering-<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the Prediction, That <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould ſuffer, with thoſe few Inſtances of <hi>Suffering-Hereticks,</hi> it is odds but Perſecutions are on the <hi>wrong ſide;</hi> and that is <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Hereſy,</hi> that is <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>tyrannical;</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince the Truths of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and of his Religion, are ſo meek, ſo charitable, and ſo merciful. And we may in this Caſe exactly uſe the words of St. <hi>Paul; But as then he that was born after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even ſo it is now;</hi> and ſo it ever will be, till <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſecond coming. This may give us a good <hi>ground of Piety</hi> from the meekneſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of Chriſtianity, that the moſt proper way, and moſt agreeable to the example of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and of his holy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for the propagation thereof, is by the <hi>ſame</hi> Meekneſs, Charity, and Mercy in which it was Inſtituted, and conſequently, to give Indulgence to tender Conſciences.</p>

The cauſes of <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Matrimony,</hi> &amp;c. termed <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Spiritual,</hi> were indeed meerly <hi>Civil,</hi> and determined by the Laws of the Secular Magiſtrate: for making of <hi>Wills,</hi> and <hi>Marrying,</hi> were regarded by <hi>Heathens</hi> as well as <hi>Christians.</hi> But for <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi> Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Eccleſiaſtical, that are properly and indeed ſuch, as <hi>Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table-duties,</hi> which concern matters of Faith and Holyneſs, and what conduceth to the eternal welfare of Mens Souls.

               <p>If Kings and Princes have Supreme Juriſdiction in <hi>Spiritual Matters,</hi> as the practiſe thereof, and the Authorities proving the ſame, do demonſtrate that they have. It will then neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the <hi>Right of Indulgence,</hi> which is a part of that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Juriſdiction, is likewiſe in thoſe Princes. He that hath Right in the whole; hath Right in every part thereof; and the grant of Indulgence is an Act of Juriſdiction in Spiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, comprehended within the general Juriſdiction which belongs to Princes, and conſequently doth belong to thoſe to whom the Supreme Juriſdiction doth belong in Spiritual matters, and that is, to Kings and Princes.</p>

<note place="margin">Calibute Downing<hi>'s Diſcourſe of the Estate Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, p.</hi> 57.</note> as to Publick Exerciſe and actions of Religion, was the original <hi>Domeſtick Diſcipline</hi> in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families, where the Father was a King and Prieſt. <hi>Adam</hi> directed his Sons to <hi>Sacrifice. Seth, Noah, Abraham,</hi> and the Princes of thoſe times, Fathers of Families, were Prieſts alſo. That the Prieſthood was in the Firſt-born, as in <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> who is taken for <hi>Shem</hi> the firſt-born of <hi>Noah;</hi> and in the reſt of the firſt-born, the Fathers of Families in thoſe times before <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> is admitted both by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Hebrews. Abraham,</hi> and every Patriarch or Prince within his Territory, and every Father of a Family within his Family, did exerciſe the office of <hi>Prieſt</hi> alſo. So it is, or ought to be at this day, That every Father of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is either in his own Perſon (if he be able) or by providing ſome fit Perſon (if his Eſtate will bear it) to perform <hi>Religious Duties</hi> in his Family, to pray and expound the Holy Scriptures there. It will not be denied, but that every ſuch Father of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily may diſpenſe with, and indulge any of his Children or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be abſent from thoſe Family-Duties, when he ſhall ſee juſt cauſe for it. And it would be hard to deny a Prince the ſame power of Indulgence to his Subjects, which is allowed to every Father of a Family, to his Children and Servants.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may in the next place look into this Juriſdiction,
<note place="margin">Exod. 29.9. Numb. 3.10.</note> as it was exerciſed by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Princes. <hi>Moſes</hi> Conſecrated, and commanded <hi>Aaron;</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſtyled the <hi>Prieſt of Prieſts,</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62687:15"/>the <hi>Supreme King,</hi>

De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi> was Propheteſs, and Judge, or Prince of <hi>Iſrael. Samuel</hi> was a Prophet, and he and moſt of the Judges of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Supreme and Spiritual, as well as Temporal Juriſdiction in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So did <hi>David, Solomon, Jehoſaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> and other Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bertramus, Menechius, Seldenus, Sigonius,</hi> &amp;c.</note> and of <hi>Judah,</hi> whereof there is plentiful men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the holy Story, and in thoſe Authors named in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, who have written on this Subject, and it is the beſt Pattern to be followed by other Princes. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word for a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> ſignifies likewiſe the <hi>Prince</hi> of a Territory; not that Prieſthood made one a <hi>Prince,</hi> or did carry <hi>Command</hi> with it; but that Princes were chief Prieſts alſo in their Territories. Before the Law given in <hi>Sinai, Moſes</hi> had cognizance as well of <hi>Sacred,</hi> as of Prophane Matters together (as they were termed) without the diſtinction of <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Civil:</hi> And this appears in the Tribunals ſet up by <hi>Jethroes</hi> advice, and in his Judgments in thoſe Sacred Cauſes; and to him the <hi>Appeals</hi> were made, whether the Matters were Sacred or Prophane; and doubtleſs in the exerciſe of this Supreme Spiritual Juriſdiction, the power of <hi>Indulgence,</hi> where he ſaw cauſe, was not denyed him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The like Juriſdiction was in the <hi>Heathen Princes,</hi> who from the Preſidents of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (although miſerably depraved) drew their Cuſtoms to have publick <hi>Prieſthoods,</hi> which were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial and Hereditary; and among them the Prince was alſo the <hi>High Prieſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Syneſ. <hi>Ep.</hi> 12.</note> The <hi>Caldean</hi> Kings were Prieſts alſo. A Prieſt and a Prince was all one amongſt the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> ſo the <hi>Magi</hi> among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the Prieſts of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> among the <hi>Grecians.</hi>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaking of Kings in the time of the <hi>Heroes,</hi> ſaith, That they were Rulers of matters of War and of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> or <hi>ſacred</hi> Things, which pertained to the Sacerdotal Function. In another place he ſaith, That the King was Leader or General of the War, and Judge or Moderator of <hi>divine Things;</hi> and to be Moderator, implies a Power and Right of Indulgence. In like manner the <hi>Roman Emperors,</hi> before the Birth of <hi>Christ,</hi> were their <hi>High Prieſts</hi> alſo.
<note place="margin">Pontiſiciam poteſtatem cum Caeſarea potentia conjunxit.</note> It is noted of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> that to the end he might fully recover into his Power the Temporalty, he joyned the <hi>Pontifical</hi> Authority with the <hi>Caeſarian</hi> Power; and ſo have all wiſe Princes, his Succeſſors: And it is not improbable,

<note place="margin">Sr. <hi>Walt. Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> in his Treatiſe of War.</note> that the right of <hi>Indulgence</hi> was part of them. The <hi>Mufty</hi> among the Turks holds all he hath at the diſcretion of the <hi>Great Sultan.</hi> Moſt Nations of the World, after the Preſident of the Hebrews, placed the Supream Spiritual Juriſdiction in their Kings and Supream Rulers, and it were improbable to conclude that the right of Indulgence was excepted out of that Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is likewiſe evident, That this Supream Spiritual Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was in the Emperours, both as to <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>matters</hi> which were termed Spiritual. Writers of Church matters do ſhow that the Clergy for 850 years together, claimed no Superiority or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, but left the ſame, and ſubmitted themſelves therein to their own Princes, who took upon them the Sovereignty in the matters, and over the Perſons which were afterwards called <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>

               <p n="9">9. The like Supreme Juriſdiction was alſo exerciſed, and ſtill is, by the Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> in Spiritual matters.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62687:17"/>Clergy themſelves, are in perfect Obedience and Submiſſion to the King, as their Supreme in matters Spiritual. All Appeals from the Proceedings of their Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Courts, as they likewiſe term them, are made to the King in his Chancery; who thereupon Ordains, under the <hi>Great Seal</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> certain Commiſſioners or Delegates, who hear and determine thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by the King's authority. And in ſome Caſes of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weight or difficulty, the King himſelf, with the advice of his Senate or Council of State, as in the <hi>last Reſort,</hi> reſolves them.

And of <hi>Ireland</hi> it is affirmed, That they have there made as many Laws againſt Proviſions, Citations, Bulls, and Briefs of <hi>Rome,</hi> as are to be found in all the Parliament Rolls of <hi>England.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Poynings Law,</hi> Enacts there the Statutes of Proviſion, and all other Laws againſt the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Alſo in the Parliament of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and in another Parliament in that Kingdom, it is declared, That the publiſhing of Bulls of Proviſion from <hi>Rome,</hi> is <hi>High Treaſon.</hi> But I may incur the Cenſure of tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to beſtow more time on this Argument, which can receive little oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it muſt be acknowledged, that generally the Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and other Princes before and out of <hi>Christanity,</hi> and the firſt Princes and Fathers of Families, have exerciſed Supreme Juriſdiction in Spiritual matters within their Territories, as a Right belonging to them; and conſequently the Right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, as part of that Juriſdiction, can hardly be denyed to them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>That ſupream Spiritual Juriſdiction in</hi> England, <hi>is in our Kings.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IT may be ſhewn in a few Inſtances of many, that this Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was in our Kings, in all ages, according to Law.</p>
               <p>If for the <hi>Stories-ſake</hi> we ſhould take our firſt ſtep as high as our <hi>Britiſh Kings,</hi> we may find in them ſome teſtimonies of it, before Chriſtianity was introduced; our Britiſh Kings were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream over the <hi>Druides,</hi> the Prieſts, the <hi>Arch-Flamines</hi> and <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> and ordered their <hi>Sacrifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ordered likewiſe all matters of that Nature, as to the ſupream Juriſdiction of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt Chriſtian Britiſh King <hi>Lucius,</hi> if you credit that Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, made that bleſſed change from <hi>Paganiſm</hi> to the Light of the Goſpel, which he and all his People embraced.</p>
               <p>He changed the Arch-Flamines and Flamines into Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, and for the <hi>Druides,</hi> entertained the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; and the actions of this King and of his Succeſſors, in the Progreſs of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> among them, do give teſtimony that ſupream Spiritual Juriſdiction was then taken to be in our Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleutherius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Anſwer to the Letters of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and his Nobles, ſtiles the King, <hi>Gods Vicar within his Kingdom;</hi> and the Vicar is <hi>in the ſtead</hi> of his Maſter, and inveſted with his Power; which no earthly Prince is capable of, as to command over the heart, and to eternity, but the eternal King of Kings: Yet as to power in this World, Kings are deputed by God as his Vicars on Earth, with as much Supremacy in Spiritual Matters, whereof men are capable, as of Temporal.</p>
               <p>It hath been ſhewed, that the Commands of Chriſt were full of Meekneſs: We read that indeed he did Scourge ſome out of the Temple, but never that he Scourged any into the Temple. He exhorts his Vicars, and all others, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly;</hi> which is commendable in all who are his Vicars, to be thus like their Maſter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place a view may be taken of the exerciſe of this Juriſdiction by our <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Daniſh</hi> Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ina</hi> ſaith, in the Preface to his Laws,

               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the third was a wiſe and Powerful Prince, and his time affords us a large view of this matter, in the Records and Printed Statutes.</p>
               <p>In his minority and in the heat of his wars in <hi>France,</hi> the Pope ſent many <hi>Briefs</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> at which the King and his Subjects were much offended, and did ſmartly oppoſe them.</p>

               <p>He entirely reſumed the right of his Crown in ſupream ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Juriſdiction.</p>

               <p>This King tranſlated <hi>Canons Secular</hi> into Regular and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

               <p>In the Nonage of <hi>R.</hi> 2. the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> again budded, and

               <p>In his time an Act makes it Death, to bring any Summons,

               <p>The King had alſo the ill fortune to have it objected againſt him in Parliament, that he had allowed of ſome Bulls from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. We come now to the times of ſeveral Kings, who found this point ſo well ſettled, that there was not much need of their ſtirring in it, yet the ſame Juriſdiction was exerciſed by them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>H.</hi> 4. time, were ſeveral Reſolutions of the Judges,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke</hi> 5 <hi>Rep. Eccleſ. Caſe.</hi> f. 22, 23, 24.</note> expreſly diſallowing the Supremacy of the Pope in this Realm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Kings.</p>
               <p>A Statute makes it a Praemunire to purchaſe Bulls from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. c. 3. 6 <hi>H.</hi> 4. c. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Another forbids the horrible Miſchiefs and damnable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> about compounding with the Popes Chamber for Firſt-fruits.</p>
               <p>Another makes it a Praemunire for any to put in execution here any Bulls for the diſcharge of Diſmes.
<note place="margin">2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. c. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In his ſons time an Act makes it a Praemunire for one by colour of Proviſions from <hi>Rome,</hi> and Licences thereupon,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. c. 9.</note> to moleſt any Incumbent.</p>
               <p>In his time the Lands of Religious houſes were in ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be taken away,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Martin Chron.</hi> p. 142.</note> the King being Petitioned to ſuppreſs them, as <hi>Nurſeries of Idleneſs, Gluttony, Leachery and Pride,</hi> and that their Revenues would bring yearly to the Kings Coffers 200000 <hi>l.</hi> and alſo maintain 15 Earls, 1500 Knights, and above 6000 men at Arms.</p>
               <p>But by the <hi>Policy</hi> and liberal offer of the Clergy, to ſupply the Kings occaſions in furtherance of his Title to <hi>France,</hi> this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was diverted.</p>
               <p>In the minority of <hi>H.</hi> 6.
<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Jo. Davis, Rep.</hi> f. 96.</note> when the <hi>Commons</hi> had deny'd the King a Subſidy, the Prelates offered a large ſupply for his Warrs, if
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62687:21"/>the Act of Proviſion were repealed: But <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> who not long before had caſt the Popes Bull into the <hi>fire,</hi> cauſed this motion to be denyed, as derogatory to the Kings Right and Supremacy.</p>
               <p>In this Kings Reign it was adjudged,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 6. f. 10. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. f. 1.</note> that the <hi>Popes Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is of no force in</hi> England, <hi>by the Common Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſucceeding Kings were not ſo active in theſe matters, nor was there ſo much occaſion for it in their time, as in the Reigns of their Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Another Judgment was, that the Popes Excommunication was of <hi>no force</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when two Legates,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. f. 10.</note> one after another came into <hi>England,</hi> they could not be admitted, till they had taken an Oath, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <hi>nothing againſt the King</hi> and his Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. f. 22.</note> 3. had a ſhort and unhappy Reign, after his wicked Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was careful to pleaſe <hi>the Clergy;</hi> yet in his time it was reſolved, <hi>That a Judgment or Excommunication at</hi> Rome, <hi>did not prejudice any man here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 7. was a prudent and wary man, not forward to diſoblige any party,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. f. 10.</note> eſpecially ſo great a one as the <hi>Clergy;</hi> yet in his time divers Reſolutions paſſed to the ſame effect as before, for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Kings Supremacy.</p>
               <p>The Judges affirmed,
<note place="margin">10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. f. 18. <hi>Perſona mixta.</hi>
                  </note> that the King is a <hi>mixt perſon,</hi> having both ſpiritual and temporal juriſdiction in him.</p>
               <p>And that the King may <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with the Eccleſiaſtical Law for <hi>Pluralities,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. f. 12.</note> and for a <hi>Baſtard</hi> to be made <hi>Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. We are now come to the great Wheel, which turned upſide down the whole courſe of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs; <hi>King H.</hi> 8. who not only reſumed abſolutely the <hi>whole ſpiritual Juriſdiction</hi> into his own hands, but totally aboliſhed the Supremacy of the Pope in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cauſe hereof ſome would attribute to his <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> but he was rather <hi>prodigal;</hi> and though none are more covetous than ſome prodigal men to get fuel for their flames, yet the humour of <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> was ſpent in his Father, and his own Education and Practice was otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>His diſpleaſure againſt the Pope about the buſineſs of <hi>Queen Katherine,</hi> and the precedent of <hi>Woolſey,</hi> added to his private
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62687:21"/>grudge; and Haughtineſs might put him upon this work, which he went through with, and that by <hi>Parliament,</hi> which he ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently commanded.</p>
               <p>It chiefly began in the 24 year of his Reign,
<note place="margin">24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 2.</note> when an Act was made, which fully recites the Kings <hi>ſupreme Juriſdiction</hi> both in Spiritual and Temporal matters, without Appeal to any foreign Princes or Potentates.</p>
               <p>It enacts that all Cauſes determinable by any ſpiritual Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall be adjudged within the Kings Authority; and if any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Appeals, Proceſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſhall iucurre a <hi>Praemunire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next year an Act was made,
<note place="margin">25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 19.</note> wherein the Clergy acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Kings <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and that they are convened by his Writ: And no <hi>Canons</hi> to be of force without his aſſent; which is enacted accordingly: And that the King may aſſign 32 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to examine the <hi>Canons,</hi> and to continue <hi>ſuch</hi> of them as they think fit, and to reſtrain the reſt. Appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> are forbid, and that Appeals from places exempt, and which were formerly to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall for the future be to the King in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; which is a great aſſerting of the Kings <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Act the ſame year declares,
<note place="margin">25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 20.</note> that the King may grant his <hi>Conge deſlier</hi> for Biſhops, and in default of Election of them, the King may nominate the Biſhop by his Letters Patents, and they to be conſecrated here.</p>
               <p>Another Act reciting the Popes Exactions for Diſpenſations,
<note place="margin">25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 21.</note> Licences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in derogation of the Imperial Crown and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Royal, enacts that none be had from <hi>Rome,</hi> and gives power to the King therein, which will be mentioned in another place.</p>
               <p>The next Parliament unites to the Crown the title of <hi>Supreme Head of the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 1.</note> and all Juriſdictions and Authorities thereto belonging.</p>
               <p>Another Act gives to the King <hi>Firſt-fruits,</hi> as the Pope had them.
<note place="margin">26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Another Act forbids <hi>Appeals to Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Another (ſince repeal'd) makes it a Praemunire to extoll or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Authority of the See of <hi>Rome:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 10.</note> And Officers to be <hi>ſworn</hi> to renounce and reſiſt it.</p>
               <p>Another Act makes void <hi>Licenſes</hi> and Indulgences from <hi>Rome,</hi>

               <p>In the 31 year of his Reign,
<note place="margin">31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 9.</note> an Act gives him power to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſuch number of Biſhops, Biſhops Seas and Churches, and to endow them with ſuch Poſſeſſions as he will.</p>
               <p>Another Act gives to the King all the reſt of the <hi>Monaſteries</hi> not diſſolved, and their Poſſeſſions. An Act of as much neglect of the Romiſh Power, and of as much Supremacy in the King in <hi>matters ſpiritual,</hi> as may be imagined.</p>

               <p>Which Supremacy was further exerciſed by this King, in the Laws made for confirmation of the Romiſh Doctrine, and the Six Articles, upon which was great ſeverity, ſome being put to death for affirming the Popes Supremacy, others for denying his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, all at the ſame time.</p>

<note place="margin">1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. c. 12.</note> One makes it Treaſon to affirm, that the King is not, or that the Pope is, <hi>ſupream Head</hi> of the Church in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>If our King (as undoubtedly he is) be a ſpiritual Perſon, it is not improper for him to grant <hi>Indulgence</hi> in matters Spiritual.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> took themſelves to be ſpiritual Perſons, and and to have ſpiritual Juriſdiction, as the Judgment and Actions of <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> and their <hi>Kings</hi> do ſhow.</p>

               <p>Though it be not a perſonal Duty in a Prince <hi>to Preach,</hi> yet he is truſted to promote the Goſpel as a principal part of his Duty; and for a Prince to Preach is no ſtrange thing, nor any diſparagement, the great <hi>Solomon</hi> is called <hi>the Preacher;</hi> and they may Preach if they pleaſe, which is an argument of their being <hi>Spiritual Perſons,</hi> and

               <p>In reaſon, the Prince is to Order and Indulge ſuch of them as he thinks fit, the better to ſerve his great end.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is agreed for Law in another Caſe, in our Books, That the Law hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven power to the King, that of right he may diſpenſe with a prohibited evil, becauſe of the impoſſibility of <hi>foreſeeing</hi> all particulars which may fall out. And that a Diſpenſation is a provident relaxation, or Indulgence of a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited evil upon conſideration of profit or neceſſity.</p>
               <p>The right to do this, being by our Law in the <hi>King,</hi> comprehends within the ſame right of the King, his granting of Indulgence in matters ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>old Law,</hi> no Lord, or Knight could go beyond Sea, becauſe thereby the Realm might be disfurniſhed of valiant men.</p>
               <p>Yet in that Caſe the King might by the Common Law, grant <hi>Licence,</hi> or Indulgence to any Lord, or Knight, or other, to go beyond Sea, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with that Law.</p>
               <p>But I am not arguing at the Bar, a point of Law, to cite all Authorities I can meet with for it; I only mention <hi>a few,</hi> to the end that by them, the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of the Law, and the <hi>Application</hi> to our preſent purpoſe, may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apprehended: I ſhall therefore forbear to cite more, and conclude with this one general ground of our Common Law, the wiſdom whereof hath thought fit, that Acts of Grace and Favour ſhould be in the <hi>Right of the King,</hi> to be diſpenſed <hi>by him,</hi> for the more obliging of his Subjects, and the gaining their affections to him.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the granting of <hi>Exemptions, Licences, Faculties, Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Non-obſtante</hi>'s, and the like Acts of Grace, are left unto the King, and are in his right to grant or deny them, as he ſhall judge fit. So it is, if a man be convicted of <hi>Felony,</hi> or <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and hath judgment of Death paſt upon him by the Law, he is to ſuffer Death; yet the Law gives the Power and Right to the King, that he may <hi>indulge</hi> this condemned perſon, and give him a pardon for his life, which is every dayes experience. And many in our time, have taſted the fruits of his Majeſties Grace and Clemency herein: And if the Common Law gives this Right of Indulgence for <hi>Life</hi> to the King, it were hard to deny it him in Spiritual matters, for not <hi>coming to Church,</hi> or the like.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That this right was in the King by the Common Law, and practice of it, may appear from many both ancient and later <hi>Precedents;</hi> ſome whereof,

               </p>
               <p>This new Doctrine and Religion wholly contrary to <hi>Paganiſme,</hi> and tending to the ſubverſion of <hi>that</hi> whereof the <hi>Brittans</hi> were ſo blindly zealous, yet tho they could hardly be perſwaded to change the Traditions of their Fathers, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they were ſo far from perſecuting of theſe Non-conformiſts to the <hi>old Religion,</hi> that they freely permitted them to preach, and to inſtruct the people in this new Doctrine and Worſhip, though wholly different from their own Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>And the King did ſo far grant Indulgence to them, and to all that would hear them; that every one had the liberty of his own Conſcience indulged to them.</p>
               <p>And becauſe theſe <hi>Preachers</hi> came from far, and that their lives were full of <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and that they inſtructed the people in <hi>pious things;</hi> the King for their maintinance, granted to them the <hi>Iſle of Glaſſenbury;</hi> each one of theſe <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> having an <hi>hide</hi> of Land given to him, and they twelve in number, they are called the <hi>twelve Hides of Glaſſenbury</hi> to this day.</p>
               <p>You ſee the <hi>Pagans</hi> were ſo far from perſecuting them, or taking any thing from them, as they gave them a livelyhood.</p>

               <p>King <hi>H.</hi> 8. not only exerciſed this right himſelf, but aboliſhed all pretence and practice thereof by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as hath been mentioned; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured this to be done, and his <hi>own right</hi> to be acknowledged, by the Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. and his Siſter Queen <hi>Mary</hi> exerciſed the ſame right, only Queen <hi>Mary</hi> advanced that which her Father and Brother had aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> followed the Precedent of her Brother, and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her Reign, when there was a ſcarcity of Miniſters that would conform to the Reformation, and it was difficult to get <hi>Preachers</hi> after that way, the Queen took upon her to give Licenſe and Indulgence <hi>to Lay-men to Preach publiquely,</hi> although they were not in Orders.</p>
               <p>And I have been particularly and credibly informed of a Gentleman in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-ſhire,</hi> who being <hi>High Sheriff</hi> of that County about 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> whoſe Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child at the writing hereof was the worthy High Sheriff there, That the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father by ſpecial Licenſe from the Queen, being a Gentleman of <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> did himſelf <hi>Preach publiquely</hi> to the <hi>Judges at the Aſſizes,</hi> when he was High Sheriff: Nor would the like be more a crime now than it was in thoſe dayes, if there were the ſame neceſſity; but Bleſſed be God we are more plenteouſly furniſht.</p>
               <p>We may now look upon ſome Precedents of our own time, ſuch as many yet alive may remember; in the times of the late K. <hi>James,</hi> K. <hi>Charles</hi> 1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In King <hi>James</hi> his time, it was Reſolved by the Judges, That all Proceedings
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62687:27"/>in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> are for the King; for which reaſon,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Ja. c. B. Tr.</hi> Hall's <hi>Caſe. Coke</hi> 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> f. 51.</note> whatſoever the Suit there be, the King may <hi>Pardon</hi> it, for thoſe Suits are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Convict or Puniſh the Party, for the Offence or <hi>Fault</hi> which the King may Pardon, and not for the perticular Intereſt of the party.</p>
               <p>This Precedent and Reſolution ſeems much to teſtifie the Kings <hi>Right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi> to any of his Subjects, whoſe Opinions in ſome <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or other matters of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> are different from the Opinions of their Magiſtrates, to which in tenderneſs of Conſcience they cannot conform; and for their Non-conformity are Puniſhable by the <hi>Spiritual Judges,</hi> (as they are termed) and by other Officers, for the Correction of that fault; and this the Judges Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that the King might <hi>Pardon.</hi> And for the King to grant an <hi>Indulgence</hi> in theſe matters, is no other but a Pardon of the Offence in them, and the particular Intereſt of <hi>no Man</hi> is concerned to hinder this Pardon or Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: And therefore by this, and divers Precedents purſuant to this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, the Kings right of giving this Indulgence is affirmed.</p>
               <p>Another Precedent in King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. time, ſeems to me to have a great reſemblance, if not to be the ſame with the Indulgence now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of, and therefore I ſhall be the more particular in the recital of it.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed thoſe Kings in their Clemency and Wiſdom, by their Letters Patents under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to grant to divers perſons of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Nations, Proteſtants then reſiding <hi>England,</hi> this Liberty and Indulgence; That they in diſtinct Congregations by themſelves, and in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Churches or other Places, might meet and exerciſe the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Worſhip of God, in ſuch Order, and according to ſuch Forms, and with <hi>ſuch Ceremonies</hi> as were, or ſhould be <hi>agreed upon among themſelves;</hi> and after the Rites and Uſages of their particular Churches and Congregations, without <hi>Conforming</hi> to the Order and Ceremonies of the <hi>Church of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>This Indulgence and Liberty was injoyed by them all the time of King <hi>James,</hi> after the grant of it.</p>
               <p>And under his Son King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. it was continued and enjoyed alſo by them, and they were not compelled to come to any <hi>Pariſh Church,</hi> or other place than their own particular Congregations and Aſſemblies: Nor were they at all queſtioned for the breach of any Law of Conformity; but this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of the King did wholly free them from Penalties of thoſe Laws, or moleſtation in the different Exerciſe of their Religion.</p>
               <p>The Parliament ſo far declared their Judgment, that this right of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was in the King, that it was one of their Objections againſt the late Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> That he <hi>endeavoured to diſturb theſe Diſſenting Proteſtants</hi> in their enjoyment of this Indulgence, and to have it taken away from them.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Biſhop anſwered, That the reaſon of his ſo doing, was becauſe the firſt Indulgence being granted to <hi>Forreigners</hi> and <hi>Strangers,</hi> who fled hither from <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and as to a Sanctuary to preſerve the Liberty of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in the Reformed Religion, and therefore it was fit and charitable to afford them ſuch Protection and Indulgence.</p>
               <p>But that thoſe who enjoyed it at preſent, were not ſuch perſecuted People, who fled hither for their Religion, but were the <hi>Children</hi> and Poſterity of thoſe,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62687:28"/>and were now become <hi>Natives and Denizens of</hi> England; and therefore ought to yield the ſame conformity to the Laws as others of the Kings Subjects did, and for that reaſon, in regard of their Non-conformity, he ſaid he moved his Majeſty to take away that Indulgence from them.</p>
               <p>But this Anſwer was not approved, the King thought fit to continue his Grace and Favour to theſe Sons of Strangers, and to preſerve his own right in granting and confirming this Indulgence.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Biſhop acknowledged this <hi>Right</hi> to be in the King, by moving him to take it away; and the Parliament acknowledged it to be in the King, by their not being ſatisfied with the Arch-Biſhops anſwer to their Charge about it, and by their Proceedings in it.</p>
               <p>And the confirmation and continuance of this Indulgence in Spiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Children of thoſe Strangers, now become Natives of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which they juſtly and deſervedly enjoy to this day, under the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Favour of our preſent Gracious Sovereign, is no ſlender Argument of his Majeſties Right to grant the ſame, and to grant the like Indulgence to any other of his Loyal Subjects.</p>
               <p>Another Precedent in our time, is upon ſeveral Acts of Parliament in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi>

                  <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Proteſtant Congregations, is a very full teſtimony and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of this right to be in the King, and that when he pleaſeth he may extend and grant the like to any other of his Native and faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Not only precedents of elder and later, and of our own time, do affirm this right to be in the King, but it ſeems alſo warranted to be in him by ſeveral Acts of Parliament: We may look as high as the time of <hi>E.</hi> 1.
<note place="margin">11 <hi>E.</hi> 1. c. 32.</note> in the Statute of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> forbidding the <hi>Proviſions</hi> of the Pope without the Kings <hi>Licence:</hi> If then he might grant that Indulgence, more ſtrongly he may do it now.</p>
               <p>The Statutes of <hi>praemunire</hi> doe highly aſſert the Kings right, as do thoſe of Proviſions, and are before in part mentioned.</p>
               <p>To come to thoſe which ſeem nearer our matter: By the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. it is enacted, That <hi>Appeals from places exempt, which were to the See of</hi> Rome,
<note place="margin">25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall be to the King in Chancery;</hi> which aſſerts his right in thoſe matters <hi>a fortiori,</hi> in granting the Indulgence now deſired.</p>
               <p>By the Statute in the 26 year of this King, it is enacted, That the King may order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by any ſpiritual Authority or Juriſdiction, ought or may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be Ordered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then it did or doth belong to any ſpiritual Juriſdiction to grant Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in ſpiritual matters, it is by theſe Statutes given unto the King.</p>
               <p>But the Pope practiſed to grant Indulgences in <hi>greater matters</hi> than any upon earth, even to the Pardon of <hi>ſins,</hi> and freeing <hi>Souls</hi> out of Purgatory, (which will not be taken as a precedent.)</p>
               <p>And as the Law of the Church was before this Statute taken, he might lawfully grant Indulgence in <hi>any ſpiritual matters whatſoever,</hi> and indulge <hi>any Non-conformity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It therefore follows, that by <hi>this Act,</hi> the King hath the <hi>ſame right,</hi> and may lawfully order and grant Indulgence in the matters for which the ſame is now deſired.</p>
               <p>By the Statute 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is recited, That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 16.</note> for profit uſed to grant to the Kings Subjects divers <hi>Authorities, Faculties, Licenſes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi> &amp;c. And it enacts, that all <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> from the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall be voyd, and that the effects and contents of <hi>Bulls, Faculties,</hi> &amp;c. purchaſed of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſhall be allowable, ſhall be confirmed under the Great Seal.</p>
               <p>By the Judgment of this Parliament, this right of Indulgence was declared and enacted to be in the King: And that ſuch Indulgences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and allowable for the people to have, (whereof the King was Judge) ſhould in the effect of them be paſſed under the Great Seal, that is, by the King, whoſe Warrant to the Chancellor doth authorize him to paſs a Grant under the <hi>Great Seal</hi> accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Statute of 1 <hi>El.</hi> reeites that in <hi>H.</hi> 8. time, divers good Laws,

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62687:29"/>the Subjects ever ſince enjoyed good order, and were diſburthened of the intollerable Charges and Vexations ſo uſurped on them.</p>
               <p>That Act aboliſheth all forreign Juriſdiction <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> within this Realm, and Enacts, That ſuch Juriſdiction, Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical, as by any Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Power or Authority had heretofore been, or lawfully might be exerciſed or uſed for the Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Perſons,</hi> and for Reformation under, and correction of the ſame, and of all manner of <hi>Errors, Hereſies, Schiſms, Abuſes, Offences,</hi> contempts and enormities, ſhould for ever by authority of that Parliament be united and annexed to the Imperial <hi>Crown</hi> of this Realm. I ſhall ſtill forbear to mention that arrogancy of granting Indulgences to reach to <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisy,</hi> to pardon <hi>Sin,</hi> at which every ſober Chriſtian may grieve, and will readily agree it not to be within this Act.</p>
               <p>Nor will it be denyed, but that the Pope practiſed here, the granting of Indulgence to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſed, and in any ſpiritual <hi>matter</hi> whatſoever, and as the Law was then taken and ſubmitted unto, he was held <hi>lawfully</hi> to exerciſe that Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>If it were ſo, then the ſame Juriſdiction, and right of Indulgence, ſo exerciſed by the Pope, is now by <hi>this Act</hi> annexed and united to the Crown, and the King poſſeſſed and re-inveſted in his ancient Right, and the ſame may be accordingly exerciſed by him.</p>
               <p>And the Power by this Act to order <hi>Errors, Schiſms,</hi> &amp;c. will comprehend the granting of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, which ſome hold to be the beſt and ſafeſt way to order <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Schiſms;</hi> and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, if there ever were a right of Indulgence exerciſed in this Realm by any <hi>lawful</hi> power, the ſame is by this Act veſted in the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I ſhall thus briefly paſs by others, and come to that Act of Parliament, which in <hi>expreſs terms</hi> ſeems to allow this Right to be in the King, or gives it to him: And this is the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>The Anſwer to Objections againſt this Right of the King.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is objected, That if this Right ſhould be in the King,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">object. </seg>
                  </label> and he ſhould exerciſe the ſame, it would be a countenance and incouragement of Schiſms and Diviſions in the Church.</p>
               <p>To which is anſwered, That the <hi>Perſecuting</hi> of different Opinions,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">anſw. </seg>
                  </label> is that which cauſeth the <hi>Schiſm,</hi> not the diſſenting in Opinion; for if one be a <hi>Non-conformiſt,</hi> he troubles nor diſquiets no others by his Nonconformity; if they let him <hi>alone,</hi> he is ſatisfied. But when he is troubled or <hi>puniſhed,</hi> becauſe he differs in opinion from ſome in Power, <hi>this</hi> cauſeth the Rent or Schiſm in the Church, which otherwiſe would be whole; the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> cut off the Diſſenters from them, and are moſt properly to be termed the <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But admitting theſe whom the Perſecutors call ſo, to be <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> yet to indulge them ſo, as that they ſhall not be <hi>puniſhed,</hi> is no more to incourage their <hi>Opinions,</hi> than it is to incourage the wearing of <hi>Scarlet,</hi> when men are <hi>not puniſhed</hi> for wearing of that, or of any other colour.</p>
               <p>The way to countenance and incourage any thing, except by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>perferments,</hi> will hardly be found effectual; the <hi>not puniſhing,</hi> is no reward; and the not puniſhing of Non-conformity, will not be found ſuch a reward or bait as to countenance and incourage <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But admit the Prince upon Emergencies of State, ſhould evidently ſee it neceſſary, to countenance or incourage <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> and that the ſame would much tend to the preſervation of the Publick peace to grant indulgence to them, without which it might be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered.</p>
               <p>If this Right of Indulgence ſhould be denied him, the duty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon preſervation could not be expected from him, the requiſites and powers neceſſary thereunto not being allowed to him.</p>

                  </label> That if the King ſhould exerciſe this Right of Indulgence, it would be a hindrance to that moſt deſirable thing in the Church of Chriſt, <hi>

               </p>
               <p>There is no way but in the unity of the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>knowledg</hi> of the Son of God to come unto a <hi>perfect man,</hi> to the meaſure of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But,
<note place="margin">Matt. 18.7.</note> Chriſt tells us, That offences muſt come, but <hi>Wo to that man</hi> by whom the offence cometh.</p>
               <p>Surely, the offence cometh more by him that perſecuteth than by him that pardoneth; and to differ from another in opinion, is no more juſtly an offence than to differ in countenance; notwithſtanding which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in countenance, yet all are of one unity and uniformity <hi>as men.</hi>

               <p>All Vines,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip Nye</hi> Beams of former Light.</note> Cedars, every Plant, and every Herb, every Beaſt and Bird, are uniform in their <hi>Kind,</hi> though there beſome difference in each of them. So it is with gracious and holy men, being <hi>a holy Seed,</hi> and having this Seed remaining in them, their converſation for the ſubſtance is the <hi>ſame,</hi> and ſo is their profeſſion of Religion, notwithſtanding ſome Minute differences (as Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> calls them,) and it is ſo viſibly <hi>uniform</hi> and the ſame, as the blind World can diſtinguiſh them from other men.</p>
               <p>So alſo in this part of their converſation, their Service of God in his Ordinances, if the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and whatſoever he in his Word hath preſcribed as neceſſary means and circumſtances from more general rules be obſerved, you will have a natural, free and comely uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and more to the Glory of God, than to have all by External injunctions caſt as it were in an artificial Mould; ſuch a forced Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in all Ages hath been the occaſion of greateſt differences and diſturbances.</p>
               <p>The neglect of Scripture Rules which guide and direct an unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in matters of ſubſtance and great conſequence; and by Canons, and Injunctions, and other ways to erect an uniformity in matters of doubtful diſpute, and not of much concernment if they were cleared: The pretence of Uniformity, and upon that account taking liberty to impoſe doubtful Traditions, hath been in all Ages an Utenſil in the hand of Church Governours, by which they have exerciſed greateſt Tyranny.</p>

               <p>There is an Uniformity ariſing from the Virtue of internal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as alſo from an external mould or frame; the one is free and natural, the other compelled and forced.</p>
               <p>Uniformity from internal Principles, is an excellency in Nature, and in Grace alſo.</p>
               <p>No neceſſary Uniformity for the beauty and good of the Church is hindred, but advanced by the King's Right to grant Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in Spiritual matters.

                  </label> That ſurely much more diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will ariſe, and more cauſe be given for it by puniſhing, than by pardoning. The one will give too much cauſe, the other gives no juſt cauſe of any diſcontent.</p>
               <p>The Wiſdom of the King will more conſider the cauſe of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, than the diſcontent it ſelf, and would himſelf have moſt cauſe of diſcontent, to be denied ſo great and neceſſary a Right, and ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the peace and welfare both of himſelf, and alſo of all ſorts of his Subjects, and without which he can hardly preſerve either.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs the beſt way will be to diſcontent as few as may be, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a time when diſcontents are too rife, and too apt to riſe; and that will be found the way to content them, which allows them their moſt deſired Intereſt in this World, their liberty by this Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are puniſhed for what they hold their Right, will be too apt and too much provoked to diſcontent, and to eſteem it an iſſue of Pride more than of Piety, and of Domineering more than of Meekneſs, to impoſe upon our Chriſtian Brethren.

               <p>It will be found undeniable, that Meekneſs, and Indulgence to ſuch

               <p>The Law is, that every one ſhall conform to the Ceremonies of the Church; theſe Diſſenters will not conform, but diſobey the Law, and if they be indulged herein, they are countenanced in their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and by this Example, others will be incouraged and expect indulgence in their diſobedience in other caſes, which may prove dangerous to Government.</p>

               <p>The Hebrew word <hi>Tachan,</hi> to order, prepare, to weigh, number and preponderate, refers this to the King.</p>
               <p>But I cannot admit Nonconformiſts to be diſobeyers of the Law. As to inſtance in a particular, The Law ſaith, That every one ſhall come to Church to hear Common-prayer, or elſe ſhall pay ſuch a penalty: He that pays the Penalty, doth as much obey the Law, as he that hears the Common-prayer; the one is agreeable to the Law as well as the other; either men muſt hear, or muſt pay; thoſe that hear, and thoſe that pay, do equally obey the Law.</p>
               <p>If then the King indulge thoſe who do not hear, that they ſhall not pay, it is no countenancing of diſobedience, becauſe there is no diſobedience in the caſe.</p>
               <p>It is only a diſpenſing with that puniſhment which is impoſed for an offence to the King, which he may pardon; or a remitting of that penalty or payment which is given to him.</p>
               <p>Every common perſon may do the ſame; if Ten pound be given to a man, he may if he pleaſe remit it; and if one recover Money in an Action, and have judgment for it; he may if he pleaſe forbear to take the Defendant in execution, or to levy the damages which the Law gives him.</p>
               <p>By the ſame reaſon the King may pardon the puniſhment, or remit the penalty which the Law impoſeth upon Nonconformiſts, and yet this is no countenancing of diſobedience.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62687:31"/>
               <p n="5">5. It is further objected, That if this right be allowed in the King,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> it would be in his power by the exerciſe of it to repeal Statutes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſent of his Parliament.</p>
               <p>Several Acts of Parliament ordain conformity; but if the King may indulge thoſe who do not conform, he doth in effect repeal thoſe Acts of Parliament, and make them to be of no force as to the Nonconformiſts.</p>
               <p>To this ſomewhat mentioned in the laſt Section may in part be for an Anſwer.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label>
               </p>
               <p>The Law enjoyns conformity, or elſe a penalty; he that ſubmits to the penalty, doth conform to the Law. And when the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgeth particular perſons as to part of theſe Laws, he doth not thereby repeal the Laws, but remit ſome of the Penalties.</p>
               <p>To repeal an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> is wholly to take it away, and to make it of no force; which our Law ſaith muſt be done by the ſame power that made it, the concurrent aſſent of the King, Lords and Commons in Parliament.</p>
               <p>But when the King grants Indulgence to ſome Nonconformiſts, he doth not thereby repeal the Acts of Conformity, which ſtill continue; but only to ſome particular perſons he remits ſome of the penalty.</p>
               <p>The Law is, that a Traytor ſhall ſuffer death; yet many have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience by his Majeſties clemency, that it is his right (if he pleaſe) to indulge and pardon the life of the Traytor. Nevertheleſs none will ſay that hereby the King repeals the Law of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>Upon a ſentence of one to be an Heretick, the Law heretofore was that a Writ <hi>de Haeretico comburendo</hi> be taken out, and the Heretick to be burned.</p>
               <p>Yet none of our Kings have been denied the Right, and have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently practiſed it, to pardon the lives of ſuch ſentenced Hereticks as they thought fit to be indulged, and yet thereby the Laws againſt Hereticks were not repealed.</p>
               <p>By the ſame reaſon the King may pardon and indulge ſome Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, and remit the Penalties which the Law impoſeth on them, and yet the Acts for Conformity are not thereby repealed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But to come nearer to the great point in queſtion,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> the main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, That this Right of the King, if it were before in him,
<note place="margin">Stat. 14 Car. 2. cap. 14.</note> yet now by his own conſent it is barred and taken away by the late Act of this preſent Parliament for Uniformity.</p>
               <p>If this be ſo, our queſtion is determined; the wiſdom and judgment of Parliament ought to bind and conclude all perſons in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who are parties, and involved in their judgments, and ought to acquieſce therein.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:62687:32"/>
               <p>And with my particular due ſubmiſſion thereunto, it ſeems to me that nothing in this Act doth take away or impeach, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Right of Indulgence in the King.</p>
               <p>One Clauſe in this Act provides, that the Penalties thereof ſhall not extend to the Foreigners, or Aliens of the foreign Reformed Churches, allowed, or to be allowed by the King, his Heirs or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Proviſo, the Parliament declares their judgment, That this Right was and is fit to be in the King.</p>
               <p>And there occurs to me no reaſon, but that the ſame Right is in the King to grant the like Indulgence to any other of his Subjects, as by this Proviſo is approved to theſe Foreigners, whoſe poſterity, now become Natives, do enjoy it.</p>
               <p>This Right was in the King, either before the Statute of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or annexed to the Crown by that Act. And either it was in him before the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. or is granted to him by that Act, as hath been before ſhewed.</p>
               <p>If any way this Right was once in the King (as unqueſtionably it was) then it cannot be barred, nor taken away from him, without expreſs words in ſome ſubſequent Act of Parliament. But there are no words in the late Act of Uniformity to bar or to take away this Right from the King; therefore it remains in him as it was before, and there is nothing in this Act to the contrary.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the King doth not diſpence with a Law, or any part of it, whereby particular Intereſts are concerned, as to thoſe particular Intereſts.</p>
               <p>Therefore that part of this Act which giveth a Right of Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to particular Patrons, upon the Nonconformity, is not to be diſpenſed with. But as to the Penalties of this Act, and of thoſe other Acts to which it relates, and which are reformation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and wherein no particular Intereſt is concerned, the King may diſpence with ſuch Laws and Penalties; as the reſolution is in <hi>Halles</hi> Caſe,
<note place="margin">Coke 5. Rep. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.

               <p>By the ſame reaſon, the King hath a right to pardon or indulge the Penalties and execution of theſe Acts in which no particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is touched, and which are to correct and puniſh the party for his offence and default againſt theſe Laws, eſpecially when there are no words in the Act to impeach, but rather to allow this right to

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Obſervations upon Examples of Perſecution.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. PErſecution is a word taken from the Latin, <hi>Perſequor;</hi> which ſignifies to follow to the extremity; and denotes the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Revenge and ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>That the good of Indulgence, and the evil of Perfecution may the better appear, ſome obſervations upon a few, of very many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples thereof in the Holy Story are here inſerted; and to begin with theſe of Perſecution.</p>
               <p>It is obſerved, that for the moſt part ungodly men excited by pride and envy, have perſecuted the godly. So it was in the firſt Perſecution in the World, when the elder Son of <hi>Adam</hi> perſecuted his Brother <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cain</hi> was an ungodly man,
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.5.</note> for unto him and to his offering the Lord had not reſpect; but <hi>Abel</hi> was a godly man, for he brought of the firſtlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof,
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.4.</note> and the Lord had reſpect unto <hi>Abel</hi> and to his offering; becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> and his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering had reſpect from God, therefore was his Brother very wroth,
<note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Halls</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi>
                  </note> and perſecuted <hi>Abel</hi> for his Religion; ſuch was the pride and envy of his heart, upon which the Ingenious Biſhop of <hi>Exon</hi> thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates:</p>
               <p>What then was the occaſion of this capital malice? <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is accepted, what was this to <hi>Cain? Cains</hi> is rejected: What could <hi>Abel</hi> remedy this? Oh envy! the corroſive of all ill minds, and the root of all deſperate actions! The ſame cauſe that moved Satan to tempt the firſt man to deſtroy himſelf and his poſterity, the ſame moved the ſecond man to deſtroy the third.</p>
               <p>It ſhould have been <hi>Cain</hi>'s joy to ſee his Brother accepted: It ſhould have been his ſorrow to ſee that himſelf had deſerved a reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. His Brother's example ſhould have excited and directed him. Could <hi>Abel</hi> have ſtayed God's fire from deſcending? Or ſhould he if he could, reject God's acceptation, and diſpleaſe his Maker, to content a Brother? Was <hi>Cain</hi> ever the further from a bleſſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Brother obtained mercy? How proud and fooliſh is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62687:33"/>which grows thus mad for no other cauſe, but becauſe God or <hi>Abel</hi> is not leſs Good? It hath been an old and happy danger to be holy.</p>
               <p>This hath commonly been the ground of Perſecution, mens piety begets envy, and envy raiſeth perſecution from proud and ungodly men, who having the world at will, becauſe others are more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God than themſelves, therefore they in pride and envy, perſecute them as <hi>Cain</hi> here did his Brother <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be an evil heart, there will be an evil eye; and if both theſe, there will be an evil hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cain</hi> perſecuted and murthered his Brother <hi>Abel</hi> for his Religion: How early (ſaith our Biſhop) did Martyrdom come into the World? The firſt man that died, died for Religion. Who dare meaſure Gods love by outward events, when he ſees wicked <hi>Cain</hi> ſtanding over bleeding <hi>Abel,</hi> whoſe Sacrifice was firſt accepted, and now himſelf is Sacrificed?</p>
               <p>Death was denounced to man as a curſe, yet behold it firſt lights upon a Saint. How ſoon was it altered by the mercy of that juſt hand which inflicted it?</p>
               <p>If death had been evil, and life good, <hi>Cain</hi> had been ſlain, and <hi>Abel</hi> had ſurvived: Now that it begins with him that God loves, <hi>Oh death where is thy ſting?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may comfort godly men being under Perſecution; and though it ſhould reach to death, yet it would be their happineſs.</p>
               <p>And for the condition of their Perſecutors, it will be like that of <hi>Cain,</hi> who becauſe he perſecuted his Brother, was caſt out from the protection of God. He that feared not to kill his Brother, fears now that whoſoever meets him, will kill him; the troubled conſcience projecteth fearful things, and ſin makes even cruel men cowardly.</p>
               <p>God ſaw it was too much favour for <hi>Cain</hi> to die, he ſhall live, but for a curſe, baniſhed from God, carrying his Hell in his boſom, and the brand of Gods vengeance in his forehead.</p>
               <p>God rejected him, the Earth repines at him, men abhor him, himſelf now wiſheth that death which he feared, and no man dares pleaſure him with a murder.</p>
               <p>How bitter is the end of him, yea without end, ſtill <hi>Cain</hi> finds that he killed himſelf more than his Brother; and in time all Perſecutors will find that they have perſecuted themſelves more than their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next Perſecution which I ſhall mention, is that of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> perſecuting the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and this was upon a Ground of Spiritual

               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had delivered their Meſſage to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and prayed his Indulgence to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to go and ſacrifice to the Lord; the Tyrant perſecuteth them the more, and ſays, <hi>Ye are idle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>ye are idle, therefore ye ſay let us go and do ſacrifice to the Lord.</hi>

               <p>Then is the River turned into Blood, and <hi>Moſes</hi> again demands the Kings Indulgence, <hi>Let my people go that they may ſerve me.</hi> But <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart is hardned, and Frogs are ſent, this made him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle relent, <hi>Intreat the Lord that he may take away the Frogs, and I will let the people go that they may ſacrifice.</hi> The Frogs being taken away, the Tyrants heart is again hardned, <hi>He will not let the people ſerve the Lord.</hi> Then Lice are ſent; and before every new Plague, leave is deſired for the people to go and ſerve their God, but <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would not grant this Indulgence, as ſoon as the Plague was removed his heart was hardened, and he would not let the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſerve the Lord their God.</p>
               <p>But upon the death of their firſt-born the King and his Servants are willing, <hi>Go and ſerve the Lord as ye have ſaid.</hi>

               <p>No ſooner are they gone, and the Plagues ceaſed, but <hi>Pharoah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to recall them, and to continue his Perſecution of them; but therein the Judgment of God appeared againſt Perſecutors, and his zeal for his people to have this Indulgence by deſtroying the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his hoſt periſhed in the Red Sea.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next Perſecution which was intended only,
<note place="margin">Eſth. 3.5, 6.</note> was that of <hi>Haman</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> Such was his pride, becauſe <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> did not bow to him, and do him reverence, that he thought ſcorn to lay hands on <hi>Mordecai</hi> alone, but thought to deſtroy all the <hi>Jews.</hi> And his pretence for this Perſecution was by ſuggeſting to the King <hi>Ahaſuerus, That there is a certain people in all the Provinces, and their Laws</hi> (that is the Laws of their Religion) <hi>are divers from all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> they were Diſſenters, <hi>neither keep they the Kings Laws,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſth. 3.8.</note> they were abſolutely Nonconformiſts, and therefore he concludes and counſels the King, It is not for the Kings profit to ſuffer them. The King himſelf was contented to indulge them, but this great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite out of pride, and his malice to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and for his ſake to all the <hi>Jews,</hi> perſwades the King thus. <hi>If it pleaſe the King let it be written, that they may be deſtroyed.</hi> The King hearkens to <hi>Haman</hi>'s
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62687:34"/>advice, and a Decree is ſent out to perſecute all the <hi>Jews</hi> to their utter deſtruction; but afterwards through Divine mercy, by the means of Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> miraculouſly prevented. And altho here was only a deſign and intention of perſecuting Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not put in action, yet ſuch was the jealouſie and wrath of God againſt the Enemies of his people,
<note place="margin">Eſth 9 25.</note> that the chief contrivers of this Perſecution, <hi>Haman</hi> and his Sons, were hanged on the Gallows, and near eighty thouſand of the Perſecutors ſlain by thoſe whoſe ruin they deſigned. And the King commanded by his Letters, That <hi>Haman</hi>'s wicked deviſe which he deviſed againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon his own head, which may terrifie all malicious or impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men from perſecuting of their Brethren.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Perſecution which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> made may likewiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us an obſervation:</p>
               <p>The King made an Image of Gold,

               <p>They informed the King,

               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in his rage and fury commanded them to be brought before him, and examined them, who ſtoutly profeſſed their Religion, and confidence in God.</p>

               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62687:36"/>
               <p n="8">8. This Chapter may be concluded with ſome few further Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon the Examples before remembred from the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>By all which it appears evidently, that in all times, and in all places, the People and Servants of God have been under ſevere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions; but what hath been the end and iſſue thereof? Eternal joy and comfort.</p>
               <p>I know the Objection is obvious, that the Examples before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and divers others which may occur, are not applicable to the ſubject matter of our preſent Diſcourſe; they are of perſecutions of the People of God, and of Chriſtians by Heathens, and by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who believed not that the Meſſias was come: but the matter now in Diſcourſe is of injoyning conformity in Sectaries and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, by the lawful Power and Authority of the Rulers of the Church of Chriſt, and therefore theſe Examples come not to this matter.</p>
               <p>But if a diſſenting Brother do judg or doubt, that what is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on his Conſcience, is contrary to the will of God; He holds himſelf equally obliged not to conform thereunto, as the Ancient Primitive Chriſtians, or the <hi>Jews</hi> held themſelves bound not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Impoſitions of Heathen Emperors, Governours, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Spiritual.</p>
               <p>And they do obſerve, that if God ſhewed ſo great diſpleaſure for thoſe Impoſitions of the Heathen upon his People; That, ſurely he will be as much diſpleaſed at the Impoſitions of Chriſtians upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and of Proteſtants upon Proteſtants, in Spiritual Matters, and which are not Fundamental, and where the publick Peace is not diſturbed.</p>
               <p>It may be further obſerved, that in all Examples of Perſecution, the Power and Authority of the King or Monarch, was made uſe of; and by the ſame Reaſon and Authority, his Power and Right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence may be exerciſed.</p>
               <p>The Obſervation of powring out of the Wrath and Vengeance of God upon the Perſecutors of his People, hath been before in part noted, and may be found throughout the Stories of thoſe Paſſages.</p>
               <p>And it is a greater breach of Charity and Chriſtian Duty, for a Profeſſor of Chriſt, than for an Unbeliever to perſecute a Servant of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Section and Chapter may be concluded with a Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Comfort of Perſecution. It was the condition of the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and will be the Condition of all faithful Servants
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62687:37"/>of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.4, 5, 8, 9, 10.</note> to be in much Patience in Afflictions, in Neceſſities, in Stripes, in Impriſonments, in Tumults, in Labours, in Watchings, in Faſtings, by Honour and Diſhonour, by evil Report and good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, as Deceivers, and yet True; as Unknown, and yet Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; as Dying, and behold we Live; as Chaſtened, and not Killed; as Sorrowful, and yet always rejoycing; as Poor, yet making many Rich; as having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all Things.</p>
               <p>Our Maſter Chriſt Jeſus, being Lord of all, yet was pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the greateſt Perſecution for our Sakes; ſhall not we then be willing to indure ſhort Perſecutions for his Sake, and the Goſpels? Theſe Perſecutions will be Comforts and Bleſſings to all that faint not, but perſevere in Righteouſneſs to the end.</p>

               <p>Fear not, theſe Stripes are the Tokens of his Love; he is no Son that is not beaten, yea, till he Smart and Cry, if not till he Bleed. No Parent corrects anothers Child, and he is no good Parent that corrects not his own.</p>
               <p>What we loſt in our height, we recover in our Miſery, a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Image of the Son of God.

Lo, his Side, Temples, Hands, Feet, all bleeding; his Face blubber'd, ghaſhly, and ſpit on; his Skin all pearled with a bloody Sweat, his Head drooping, his Soul heavy to the Death.</p>
               <p>No man can follow Chriſt without his Croſs, much leſs reach him; and if none ſhall reign with Chriſt, but thoſe that ſuffer with him; what ſhall become of thoſe jolly Ones of this World?</p>
               <p>Go now, thou dainty Worldling, and pleaſe thy ſelf in thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; Laugh always, and be ever applauded; it is a woful Felicity that thou ſhalt find in Oppoſition to thy Redeemer.</p>
               <p>He hath ſaid, Bleſſed are ye that weep; who can believe this, and not rejoyce in his own heart? Why bleſſed? For ye ſhall laugh.</p>
               <p>Behold we ſhall weep on Earth, ſhall laugh in Heaven; we that now weep with Men, ſhall laugh with Angels; we that weep for a Time, ſhall laugh for Ever.</p>

               <p>Who would not be content to defer his Joy a little, that it may be Perpetual and Infinite?</p>
               <p>In Heaven you ſhall ſee no more Palms than Croſſes; you ſhall ſee none crowned, but thoſe that have wreſtled with Croſſes and Sorrows, to Sweat, yea, to Blood, and have overcome; and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, ye ſhall be crowned.</p>
               <p>A reward truly great, a Crown for a few Groans; an Eternal Crown of Life and Glory, for a ſhort and momentary Suffering.</p>
               <p>How juſt is St. <hi>Pauls</hi> account, <hi>That the Afflictions of this preſent Life, are not worthy of the Glory which ſhall be ſhewed unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ſay you, Would you not be afflicted? Would you not be perſecuted? Whether had you rather mourn for a while, or for ever? One muſt be choſen. Whether had you rather rejoyce for one fit, or always? you would do both. Pardon me, it is a fond Covetouſneſs, and idle Singularity; what, that you alone may fare better than all Gods Saints! That God ſhould make that way ſmooth to you, which all the Patriarchs, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Confeſſors, Chriſt himſelf, have found rugged and bloody!</p>
               <p>A way with this Self-love, and come down you ambitious Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> and ere you think of ſitting near the Throne, be content to be called to the Cup. Now is your tryal, let your Saviour ſee how much of his bitter Potion you can pledg, then ſhall ye ſee how much of his Glory he can afford; be content to drink of his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Gall, and ye ſhall drink new Wine with him in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

IN this Argument, We may take a riſe from before the Flood, and find, that in all Ages to this day, generally Indulgence hath been given in Spiritual Matters, and the right of giving it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by Monarchs; and we may begin with the Indulgence which <hi>Noah</hi> had.</p>

                  <hi>and perfect in his Generations, and Noah walked with God, but the earth was corrupt before God, and filled with violence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Noah</hi> differed as much from the People of the Earth in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, as could be; yet, even that corrupt Generation indulged <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family to enjoy the freedom of their Conſcience; and <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf was a Preacher of Juſtice,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5. Rabbi Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezer, c. 22.</note> and as a <hi>Rabbi</hi> ſaith, he preached to the old World, and ſaid, Turn ye from your ways, and from your evil Works, that the Waters come not upon you, and cut off the whole Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But ſome may object, That <hi>Noah</hi> was a King, and might give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to himſelf, and he received none from others.</p>
               <p>It is acknowledged, that <hi>Noah</hi> was a King both before and after the Flood; and of the ten Kings of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> who reigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, the laſt is reckoned by <hi>Cedren</hi> and others, to be <hi>Xiſuther,</hi> who was <hi>Noah;</hi> and in him ſome of the <hi>Greek</hi> Stories con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that Eaſtern Kingdom of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> through the Flood; and affirm that <hi>Noah</hi> was King about 180 years before the Flood, and that his Kingdom continued to his Death, and that then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed it to his Son <hi>Seth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I ſhall not make much inquiry into this matter; if he were a King, he gave good Example, by ſeeking to convert his People by preaching, rather than by puniſhing of them.</p>
               <p>If he were not a King, then was the Indulgence that he enjoyed the more conſiderable, and may be alſo exemplary.</p>

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> was alſo indulged by the King of <hi>Gerar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 20.11.</note> tho he <hi>thought ſurely the fear of God is not in this place.</hi>

                  <hi>we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have ſent thee away in peace.</hi> Even <hi>Philiſtines</hi> indulged this Servant of God, and amongſt them he built an Altar, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped his God without diſturbance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> payed his Devotions at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and had his Liberty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence in <hi>Labans</hi> Houſe, from whoſe perſwaſion in Spiritual Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he much differed.</p>
               <p>In his return from thence, in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 33.18, 19, 20.</note> he purchaſed a Field, and built an Altar, and was indulged by <hi>Hamor</hi> the <hi>Hivite,</hi> Prince of the Country. He enjoyed the like Freedom at <hi>Bethel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 35.5.</note> and in <hi>Egypt,</hi> after he went down thither; both he and all his Family enjoyed their Liberty in Spiritual Matters, and were not diſturbed for many years.</p>
               <p>Hereupon it may be obſerved, That this Indulgence was given by Kings, and allowed to the Servants of God, even by <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> much more may the like be expected from Proteſtants, to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>The next Indulgence that we meet with in time the holy Story, was that given by <hi>Pharoah</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord was with Joſeph, and he was a proſperous man;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 39.2, 4.</note> and the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> his Maſter, not only gave him the Liberty of his Conſcience, but preferred him to be Overſeer of his Houſe, and his godly Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition appeared in his Carriage to his Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>After he had interpretd <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Dream, tho he much differed in his perſwaſion in Spiritual Matters from the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> yet the King ſeeing his Wiſdom and Spirit, <hi>made him ruler of the Land,</hi>

               <p>And the difference of Perſwaſion in Spiritual Matters, between the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> was ſuch, That they would not eat together, as appears in the Entertainment which <hi>Joſeph</hi> made for his Brethren. When <hi>they ſet on bread for him by hemſelf,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 43.32.</note> 
                  <hi>and for them by themſelves, and for the Egyptians by themſelves, becauſe the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.</hi>

               <p>The reaſon whereof (as <hi>Pererius</hi> notes) was becauſe the <hi>Hebrews</hi> killed the Cattle for their food and ſacrifice,
<note place="margin">Coment. Pererii in Gen. 43.33.</note> and eat of them, which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> worſhipped as their Gods; therefore the perſwaſion of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and of his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of his Brethren, was ſufficiently different from that of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in Spiritual matters, yet were they therein indulged by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Succeſſors. And we read of no diſturbance of them in thoſe matters until <hi>Moſes</hi> required of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> an Indulgence for them to go into the Wilderneſs to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their God, which the King denied, becauſe God had hardened his heart, and purpoſed to manifeſt his own power, and his mercy to his people, in delivering them from bondage; and what was the iſſue of the denial of that Indulgence, is ſet forth by <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Story of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This may lead us to a conſideration of what Indulgence was granted by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves, being next in order of time.</p>
               <p>It is agreed by all Authors, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had Supreme Spiritual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in him, as his judgments in Spiritual Caſes given by him do teſtifie.</p>
               <p>But in his judgments in Spiritual Caſes, we find none againſt any ones freedom of Conſcience and Opinion, except in caſe of Idolatry, Breach of ſome poſitive Law of God, or for Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>And in that of Blaſphemy in the caſe of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Womans Son whoſe Father was an <hi>Aegyptian, Moſes</hi> would adjudg no puniſhment of him till firſt the mind of the Lord might be ſhewed, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that he ſhould be put to death.</p>
               <p>Many <hi>Egyptians</hi> and Strangers came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but we read of no Perſecution of any of them for different Opinions, nor any puniſhed for any Spiritual matter, but in the caſes before mentioned.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, That <hi>Moſes</hi> was not a Soveraign King, and could not Exerciſe that Juriſdiction as other Kings might in ſuch caſes, which perhaps was the reaſon that ſuch Diſſenters were not puniſhed.</p>
               <p>To which is anſwered, That <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Soveraign King, as Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute as any other Prince, and knew as much of the mind of God as ever any King did, which was revealed to him; and accordingly he Exerciſed his Kingly Authority both in this matter of Indulgence, and in all other matters.</p>
               <p>That he was King,
<note place="margin">Deut. 33.5.</note> appears in the expreſs terms of the Text, <hi>And he was King in Jeſhurun.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But this may be cenſured of too much curioſity. I have the rather inſiſted thereon, to ſhew that he who was the <hi>meekeſt man upon earth,</hi> and highly indulged Gods people, was a <hi>King;</hi> and it will become all Kings to imitate his Pattern.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Upon the ſame Ground, I proceed to the Indulgence of <hi>Joſhua, Moſes</hi> Succeſſor, who was alſo Prince or King in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He had the ſame authority as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, delegated to him from God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to by the people, who promiſe him,
<note place="margin">Joſh. 1.16.</note> 
                  <hi>All that thou commandeſt us, we will do; and whitherſoever thou ſendeſt us, we will go; according as we hearkened unto Moſes in all things, ſo will we hearken unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do not find that he was ſevere againſt any Diſſenters from his Opinion, but in his admirable Expoſtulation with the people, he leaves it to them: <hi>If it ſeem evil unto you this day to ſerve the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſh. 24.15.</note> 
                  <hi>chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve, whether the Gods which your Fathers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that were on the other ſide of the flood, or the Gods of the Amorites in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62687:40"/>whoſe land ye dwell.</hi> Then he makes and declares his own profeſſion of Religion, <hi>But as for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſought not to convince the people by ſevere Laws and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but by meek Exhortations and Admoniſhments, reaſoning the matter with them:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye forſake the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſh. 24.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſerue ſtrange Gods, then he will turn and do you hurt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſh. 24.21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>and conſume you after that he hath done you good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the people ſaid, <hi>Nay, but we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ye are witneſſes againſt your ſelves that ye have choſen the Lord to ſerve him; and they ſaid, We are witneſſes. Now therefore,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>put away the ſtrange Gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So Joſhua made a Covenant with the people, and ſet them a Statute and an Ordinance in Shechem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This way of meekneſs and Indulgence <hi>Joſhua</hi> held the beſt way to perſwade the people to Conformity, to put away the ſtrange Gods which were among them, and to incline their heart unto the Lord God; and it is an excellent precedent to be followed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The next in order is to conſider of the Indulgence which the Judges and Kings gave to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereof there is not much to be gathered, more than what is before remembred in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in the times of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The times wherein there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (that is, no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour nor Government) when every one did that which ſeemed right in his own eyes, relate to Civil as well as Spiritual matters, and were rather times of Anarchy, than of Indulgence.</p>
               <p>But both the <hi>Judges,</hi> who were Monarchs, and a kind of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Kings by name,</hi> did generally indulge all Perſons in matters Spiritual, except in caſes of Blaſphemy, Idolatry, or breach of the known Law of God.</p>
               <p>To write the Particulars of theſe times, would take up too much of ours; they are obvious in the Holy Story, which every ſervant of God will take delight to read.</p>
               <p>And throughout all the paſſages of them, it will appear that they were indulgent to different perſwaſions in matters of their Law, wherein (as to Expoſitions, and ſome weighty points) there were many different opinions, whereof there will be occaſion to make ſome mention by and by, and that theſe Diſſenters were not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
               <p>It will likewiſe be manifeſt, that all Indulgence in matters of this nature proceeded from the Judges and Kings, who by their Exerciſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62687:40"/>thereof ſhewed that the Right of Indulgence was in them, though the Caſes before mentioned were not to be diſpenced with, but by ſinning againſt God, and tranſgreſſing the Law which he had given unto his People, and which will not be done by granting an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence now deſired.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Time will be wanting to inſiſt on theſe, and I muſt omit many other examples in the Word of Truth of Indulgence in Spiritual matters, and come to that which may ſerve inſtead of all others: the unerring great Examplar, our Lord Jeſus, whoſe infinite wonderful indulgence and mercy to his unworthy Creatures, gives a ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke to all perſecuting earthly powers, and fully inſtructs them to give indulgence to thoſe over whom he hath ſet them.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Redeemer God Omnipotent, knew the inclinations and opinions of all mens hearts and ways, who were juſt and righteous, who were wicked and ungodly, who were ſincere, and who were hypocrites; who were faithful, and who unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>Yet was he graciouſly pleaſed to make no diſtinction,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.6. Acts. 10.43. John 3.15.</note> but indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all, both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> juſt and unjuſt, righteous and ſinful; he gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, that whoſoever believes in him ſhall have remiſſion of Sins, ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting Life.</p>
               <p>Our Jeſus who inhabiteth Eternity, liveth for ever, and can do whatſoever pleaſeth him, was pleaſed in his great humility and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Mankind, to come down from Heaven upon the Earth, and to take our vile Nature upon him.</p>
               <p>How unfit is it for ſinful Duſt and Aſhes, whoſe Breath is in their Noſtrils, who are but as of yeſterday, to aſcend the Throne of God, to take his Authority on them, to ſit in Judgment upon the Hearts and Conſciences of Men?</p>
               <p>The Lord of Life and Glory humbled himſelf, and became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to death, even the death of the Croſs, that he might thereby purchaſe his Enemies eternal Life.</p>
               <p>How unanſwerable to this, is it for Powers made of Dirt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Foundations, to condemn their Friends to death, that will not be of the ſame judgment with theſe Rulers?</p>
               <p>The ſearcher of Hearts allows a freedom to all mens Hearts and Conſciences to ſerve him in ſuch ways as they think moſt agreeable to his Divine Will.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:62687:41"/>
               <p>How unfit it is for any earthly Govornours to attempt an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the frame of the hearts of men, to compel them to ſerve God in ſuch ways as are moſt agreeable to the will of the Governours, and contrary to the Hearts and Conſciences of thoſe whoſe good only is concerned.</p>
               <p>Chriſt exhorteth all to Kindneſs and Indulgence,
<note place="margin">Luke 4.18.</note> and affirms, That he was ſent to heal the broken hearted. How unfit it is for his Vicegerents to wound yet more the broken hearted! He was ſent to preach deliverance to the Captives; How contrary is it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim impriſonment or baniſhment to thoſe whom Chriſt hath made free?</p>
               <p>He was ſent to recover ſight to the Blind; thoſe who are ſent by him, have no Commiſſion to put out the Eyes of thoſe that ſee, to torment and puniſh their Brethren, becauſe they ſee not with their Rulers Eyes.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was ſent to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed; and ſurely he hath not ſent any of his Officers to bruiſe his Members, and to take away their liberty or lives from them.</p>
               <p>The Son of God ſaith, <hi>If the Son make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed.</hi> How contrary is it for thoſe in Power to impoſe upon the Conſciences of them under Authority, whereby they take away that freedom which the Son, hath given to all his Servants?</p>
               <p>He ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall be free.</hi> But theſe impoſers ſay, Ye ſhall not be free.</p>
               <p>Proud Fleſh contradicts the Spirit; Man, God; the Creature, his Creator and Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Holy Diſciples of our Lord Chriſt, inſpired and inſtructed by him, followed the Example of their Maſter, in giving Indulgence to others, though differing in ſome Opinions.</p>
               <p>When the diſſention aroſe among the Brethren, touching Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and the Apoſtles and Elders came together to conſider of it,
<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> relates to them, <hi>God made choice amongſt us, that the Gentiles by my mouth ſhould hear the word of the Goſpel, and believe. And God which knoweth the heart, bare them witneſs, giving them the Holy Ghoſt, even as he did unto us, and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by Faith. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neck of the Diſciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe, that through the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall be ſaved even, as they.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62687:41"/>
               <p>Then <hi>James</hi> declares his Sentence, That we trouble not them, who from among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are turned to God: Then he adviſeth, and accordingly it was agreed by the whole Church, to ſend them Meſſengers, and to write Letters by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Foraſmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us, have troubled you with words, ſubverting your Souls, ſaying, You muſt be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and keep the Law, to whom we gave no ſuch Commandment: It ſeemed good to us, to ſend choſen men to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than theſe neceſſary things, That ye abſtain from meats offered to Idols, and from Blood, and from things Strangled, and from Fornication; from which if you keep your ſelves, ye ſhall do well. Fare ye well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a very high Example of Indulgence, warranted by the authority and judgment of the Apoſtles and Elders, and of the whole Church, and of the Holy Ghoſt likewiſe, to whom it ſeemed good not to lay burthens upon the Servants of Chriſt, but in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things; and it would be found more agreeable to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt to give this Indulgence, than to impoſe unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or Ceremonious burthens upon our Brethren.</p>
               <p>The Holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> declares this Doctrine from the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: <hi>One believes that he may eat all things; another who is weak, eateth Herbs:</hi> Then he exhorteth to this Indulgence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not, judg him that eateth. One man eſteemeth one day above another, another eſteemeth every day alike: let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, why doſt thou judg thy Brother? Or why doſt thou ſet at naught thy Brother? We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt. Let us not judg one another any more, but judg this rather, That no man put a ſtumbling Block, or an occaſion to fall, in his Brothers way. And he that doubteth, is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith; for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of Faith, is Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We then that are</hi> ſtrong, <hi>ought to bear the Infirmities of the weak,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>and not to pleaſe our ſelves.</hi> Let every one of us pleaſe our Neighbour for his good to Edification, which is not done by perſecuting mens Neighbours for their Nonconformity.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:62687:42"/>
               <p>The ſame Apoſtle tells us,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.12.</note> 
                  <hi>When ye ſin ſo againſt the Brethren, and wound their weak Conſciences, ye ſin againſt Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſurely they do wound Mens weak Conſciences, who would force them to a Conformity.</p>
               <p>He ſaith in another place,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Why is my Liberty judged of anothers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</hi> that is, it ought not to be ſo judged, every one ought to have his Liberty,
<note place="margin">Jer. 34.15.</note> as the Prophet commendeth it, <hi>Ye had done right in proclaiming Liberty, every man to his Neighbour.</hi>
               </p>

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.17</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerteth, That <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty;</hi> it followeth, that where a juſt Liberty is denied, that is by another Spirit.</p>
               <p>He exhorts,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.32.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye kind one to another, tender hearted;</hi> which will ſcarce be thought of thoſe, who deny a juſt Indulgence. And <hi>let each eſteem others better than themſelves;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.3.</note> which they do not, who perſecute others, becauſe they are not.</p>
               <p>Jeruſalem <hi>which is above,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4.26. and 5.13.</note> 
                  <hi>is free;</hi> and we are exhorted to <hi>ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free;</hi> we have been called unto Liberty.</p>
               <p>Very many Admonitions and Expreſſions of the like Nature of the Diſciples of Chriſt, are obvious in the Holy Scripture; by which the Example of thoſe holy and inſpired Servants of Chriſt is left unto us; not only warranting, but in effect, injoining a juſt Freedom and Indulgence to be given to our Fellow-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter it ſeems to me (with Submiſſion to better Judgment) very evident,</p>
               <p>That an Indulgence in matters Spiritual, is fit to be granted from the grounds of Polity and Piety.</p>
               <p>To demonſtrate which, I have only in the general collected ſuch Grounds as I met with, and time allowed; whereby it ſeems to me fit that ſuch Indulgence be granted.</p>
               <p>That the Supream Spiritual Juriſdiction is in Kings and Princes; and in <hi>England,</hi> in our Kings.</p>
               <p>That as a conſequence thereof, the right of granting Indulgence in Spiritual Matters, is in his preſent Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Then, I have offered ſome Anſwers to Objections againſt this Right.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I have made ſome few Obſervations upon Examples, in the holy Story, of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and of <hi>Indulgence</hi> in Spiritual Matters. From all which, I may preſume to ſay, That to me (under Correction) it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62687:42"/>ſeems <hi>manifeſt,</hi> that our King hath this right of Indulgence; and that as it is of Right in our King, ſo 'tis one of the higheſt and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt beautiful <hi>Flowers</hi> of his <hi>Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that, if this right were not in the <hi>King,</hi> he would thereby be much diſabled from performing his Office as <hi>King,</hi> in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſchiefs and great Inconveniences to the Publick, in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Trade, Wealth, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of his Kingdoms, in providing for his <hi>Own,</hi> and his Subjects <hi>Security;</hi> and in doing that, which will much tend to the <hi>Honour of God,</hi> to the <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> of Himſelf and all his <hi>People,</hi> and to the general good of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
